# üî® BUILD UP NOT DOWN - Restoring Missing Features

## What Was Broken (NOT Acceptable!)

1. **Missing News Ticker** - The ticker at the top of the page was removed
2. **Changed Header** - UnifiedHeader replaced MasterLayout, losing features
3. **Broken Navigation** - Practice area pages causing 500 errors
4. **Missing Features** - Features were removed instead of fixed

## What I Just Fixed (Commit: a5af66980)

### 1. Restored MasterLayout

- Changed root layout.tsx from using UnifiedHeader to MasterLayout
- MasterLayout includes:
  - ‚úÖ News ticker at the top
  - ‚úÖ ConsistentHeader with full navigation
  - ‚úÖ Proper breadcrumbs
  - ‚úÖ Language support

### 2. Why This Happened

- Previous "fix" for double headers removed too much
- UnifiedHeader was created as a simplified version
- But it lost critical features like the ticker

## Still Need to Fix

### 1. 500 Errors on Navigation

- Practice area pages exist but may have template issues
- Need to check ModernPracticeAreaTemplateV2
- Ensure all routes work properly

### 2. Verify All Features

- News ticker should be visible at top
- All practice area pages accessible
- Navigation menu complete
- No 500 errors

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy this fix** - Ticker and proper header restored
2. **Test all navigation** - Ensure no 500 errors
3. **Verify practice areas** - All pages load correctly
4. **Check Spanish pages** - Both languages work

## BUILD UP NOT DOWN Philosophy

- ‚ùå WRONG: Remove features to "fix" problems
- ‚úÖ RIGHT: Fix the actual issues and enhance

We're bringing back ALL features and making them work properly!
