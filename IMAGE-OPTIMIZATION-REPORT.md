## Recommendations for Future

1. **Image Guidelines**:

   - Use WebP format for new images when possible
   - Compress images before upload (target <100KB for photos)
   - Use appropriate dimensions (max 800px width for most use cases)

2. **Maintenance**:

   - Regular audit of `/public/images/` folder
   - Remove unused images when features are deprecated
   - Consider automated image optimization in build process

3. **Performance**:
   - Consider implementing Next.js Image optimization
   - Add lazy loading for below-the-fold images
   - Implement responsive images with srcset

## Files Modified

- Updated image references in 200+ TypeScript/React files
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All images display correctly with improved load times

## Backup

Original optimized files are preserved with `-original.png` suffix and can be restored if needed.
