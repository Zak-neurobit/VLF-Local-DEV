  contentType: 'legal_guide',
  targetAudience: 'potential_clients',
  tone: 'educational',
  wordCount: 2000,
  language: 'en',
  location: 'North Carolina',
  urgency: 'medium',
  includeCallToAction: true,
  aiOverviewOptimization: true, // ⭐ Enable AI Overview optimization
  voiceSearchFocus: true        // ⭐ Enable voice search optimization
});

console.log('AI Overview Score:', result.aiOverviewScore);
console.log('FAQ Questions Generated:', result.aiOverviewOptimization?.faqSection.questions.length);
```

### Option B: Using the Standalone AI Overview Agent
```typescript
import { AIOverviewOptimizationAgent } from '@/lib/crewai/agents/ai-overview-optimization-agent';

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
