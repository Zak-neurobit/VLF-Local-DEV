The right method for your situation will depend on which relatives you are looking to bring into the United States, among other factors. \nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our compassionate attorneys handle a full range of family-based immigration matters. With more than 35 years of experience, we understand the process of obtaining the necessary visas and other credentials can be complicated and time-consuming. However, we also recognize the benefits that families enjoy when they are able to be together legally in the United States. If you are looking to obtain any type of family visa for your loved ones, our team is ready and willing to provide the guidance and representation you need.\nWhat Are Immediate Relatives?\nThe term “immediate relatives” has a very specific meaning under U.S. immigration laws. It refers to the spouse and unmarried children under age 21 of a legal United States citizen. If the citizen is over the age of 21, his or her parents are also considered immediate relatives. The definition of “immediate relatives” is important because the United States government allows a U.S. citizen to sponsor his or her immediate relatives in obtaining immigrant visas to enter and remain in the U.S. permanently. Unlike other types of family visas, immediate relative visas are not limited to a certain number annually.\nObtaining an Immediate Relative Visa\nIn order to obtain an immediate relative immigrant visa for a foreign national relative, a number of requirements must be met. These requirements include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe sponsoring U.S. citizen must file a completed Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) on behalf of each relative needing a visa.\nThe relationship between the foreign national and the citizen sponsor must be documented. Such documentation may include marriage and birth records. \nIf the relative is a spouse, the sponsor must prove the marriage is bona fide. This means that the marriage was not just part of the effort to gain entry to the United States. \nIf the marriage began less than two years ago, the foreign spouse is only eligible for conditional permanent residency for two years. An additional filing will be needed to lift the conditions upon a showing that the marriage is bona fide. \nThe sponsoring U.S. citizen will usually need to file an affidavit of support to show that the relative applicant will not require public assistance if the application is approved. \n\nThe processing of the application will depend on whether the foreign relative is currently in the United States. If the relative is already here, an Adjustment of Status application may be filed at the same time as the I-130. If the relative is outside the U.S., the application will be handled via consular processing. \nNorth Carolina Immigration Lawyers You Can Trust\nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we know that the immigration laws and processes of the United States can be confusing.

      "Under the current immigration laws of the United States, there are several methods available to U.S. citizens for bringing family members who live abroad into the United States legally. The right method for your situation will depend on which relatives you are looking to bring into the United States, among other factors.",
      "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our compassionate attorneys handle a full range of family-based immigration matters. With more than 35 years of experience, we understand the process of obtaining the necessary visas and other credentials can be complicated and time-consuming. However, we also recognize the benefits that families enjoy when they are able to be together legally in the United States. If you are looking to obtain any type of family visa for your loved ones, our team is ready and willing to provide the guidance and representation you need.",
      "The term “immediate relatives” has a very specific meaning under U.S. immigration laws. It refers to the spouse and unmarried children under age 21 of a legal United States citizen. If the citizen is over the age of 21, his or her parents are also considered immediate relatives. The definition of “immediate relatives” is important because the United States government allows a U.S. citizen to sponsor his or her immediate relatives in obtaining immigrant visas to enter and remain in the U.S. permanently. Unlike other types of family visas, immediate relative visas are not limited to a certain number annually.",
      "In order to obtain an immediate relative immigrant visa for a foreign national relative, a number of requirements must be met. These requirements include, but are not limited to:",
      "The processing of the application will depend on whether the foreign relative is currently in the United States. If the relative is already here, an Adjustment of Status application may be filed at the same time as the I-130. If the relative is outside the U.S., the application will be handled via consular processing.",
      "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we know that the immigration laws and processes of the United States can be confusing. We also know that a single mistake could quickly derail your efforts toward bringing your family together in America. With this in mind, we provide thorough guidance in all types of family-based immigration matters, including immediate relative visas.",
      "When you choose our firm, you and your family become our priority. We will help you understand all of your available options for obtaining the visas your relatives need. Our team will also assist you in completing the necessary paperwork and providing the supporting documentation that will give you the best chance of getting your application approved. Along the way, we will communicate openly and honestly with you so that you remain fully up to date on the progress of your case.",

The right method for your situation will depend on which relatives you are looking to bring into the United States, among other factors. \nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our compassionate attorneys handle a full range of family-based immigration matters. With more than 35 years of experience, we understand the process of obtaining the necessary visas and other credentials can be complicated and time-consuming. However, we also recognize the benefits that families enjoy when they are able to be together legally in the United States. If you are looking to obtain any type of family visa for your loved ones, our team is ready and willing to provide the guidance and representation you need.\nWhat Are Immediate Relatives?\nThe term “immediate relatives” has a very specific meaning under U.S. immigration laws. It refers to the spouse and unmarried children under age 21 of a legal United States citizen. If the citizen is over the age of 21, his or her parents are also considered immediate relatives. The definition of “immediate relatives” is important because the United States government allows a U.S. citizen to sponsor his or her immediate relatives in obtaining immigrant visas to enter and remain in the U.S. permanently. Unlike other types of family visas, immediate relative visas are not limited to a certain number annually.\nObtaining an Immediate Relative Visa\nIn order to obtain an immediate relative immigrant visa for a foreign national relative, a number of requirements must be met. These requirements include, but are not limited to:\n\nThe sponsoring U.S. citizen must file a completed Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) on behalf of each relative needing a visa.\nThe relationship between the foreign national and the citizen sponsor must be documented. Such documentation may include marriage and birth records. \nIf the relative is a spouse, the sponsor must prove the marriage is bona fide. This means that the marriage was not just part of the effort to gain entry to the United States. \nIf the marriage began less than two years ago, the foreign spouse is only eligible for conditional permanent residency for two years. An additional filing will be needed to lift the conditions upon a showing that the marriage is bona fide. \nThe sponsoring U.S. citizen will usually need to file an affidavit of support to show that the relative applicant will not require public assistance if the application is approved. \n\nThe processing of the application will depend on whether the foreign relative is currently in the United States. If the relative is already here, an Adjustment of Status application may be filed at the same time as the I-130. If the relative is outside the U.S., the application will be handled via consular processing. \nNorth Carolina Immigration Lawyers You Can Trust\nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we know that the immigration laws and processes of the United States can be confusing.
