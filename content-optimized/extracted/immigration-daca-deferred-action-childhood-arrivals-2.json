However, remaining eligible to live and work in the U.S. free from the danger of being deported is among the top concerns that many immigrants in the country face. \nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our skilled immigration lawyers understand these types of worries and the anxiety they often cause immigrants and their families. We also realize that many undocumented immigrants came to the United States at a young age and have lived here ever since. As they get older, these individuals often struggle to support themselves, and they are at risk of deportation. If this describes your situation, you may be eligible for relief through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—also known as DACA.\nWhat is DACA?\nIn 2012, President Barack Obama signed the executive order that created a program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The intent of DACA is to offer protection to individuals who came to the United States as children and who either overstayed their visas or were never documented due to the actions of their parents. DACA can provide assistance to those who are facing deportation or removal proceedings, as well as individuals who wish to remain in the U.S. for employment purposes. \nDACA is a type of discretionary relief, which means that it is not automatically granted, and it can be revoked at any time. It is also important to understand that DACA does not give young immigrants lawful status in the United States. Instead, it is an acknowledgment from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) that actions to remove the applicant will be delayed for two years, with renewals possible. Those granted relief under DACA are also usually eligible to get a work permit and a Social Security number, which is often helpful in finding a job and obtaining a driver’s license. \nEligibility Requirements for DACA\nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we know that the immigration laws of the United States can be complex and confusing. Unfortunately, the guidelines that pertain to DACA are no different. However, the criteria for applying for DACA relief are relatively straightforward. If you wish to apply for relief under DACA, all of the following must be true:\n\nYou came to the United States before your 16th birthday.\nYou were not older than 30 on June 15, 2012 (the date the DACA executive order took effect).\nYou have never been convicted of a felony or a significant misdemeanor.\nYou graduated high school, obtained a GED, are still in school, or are a veteran of the U.S. armed forces.\nYou have lived in the United States since June 15, 2007.\nYou had no legal immigration status as of June 15, 2012.\n\nYou must also be at least 15 years old at the time of your application, unless you are currently facing removal proceedings or a final removal or voluntary departure order has been issued.\nProtecting Your Best Interests in North Carolina\nThe knowledgeable lawyers at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC have over 35 years of combined immigration law experience. We realize the DACA relief does not change your immigration status, nor does it allow you to stay in the U.S. indefinitely. Instead, it gives you additional time to figure out how to remain in the United States legally. Depending on your situation, you may be able to seek a family-based immigrant visa, which in turn, could allow you to apply for lawful permanent resident (green card) status. Our attorneys can help with your application for DACA, as well as any necessary follow-up action so that you can enjoy the full benefits of living in the United States legally.\nWe Are Here to Help You\nFor the most up-to-date information about the availability of relief through DACA, or for help getting your application started, contact our office. Call  or 919-626-8450 to schedule a free consultation at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC today. We serve clients in Charlotte, Smithfield, Raleigh, Mecklenburg County, Johnston County, Wake County, and the surrounding communities.

However, remaining eligible to live and work in the U.S. free from the danger of being deported is among the top concerns that many immigrants in the country face. \nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our skilled immigration lawyers understand these types of worries and the anxiety they often cause immigrants and their families. We also realize that many undocumented immigrants came to the United States at a young age and have lived here ever since. As they get older, these individuals often struggle to support themselves, and they are at risk of deportation. If this describes your situation, you may be eligible for relief through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—also known as DACA.\nWhat is DACA?\nIn 2012, President Barack Obama signed the executive order that created a program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The intent of DACA is to offer protection to individuals who came to the United States as children and who either overstayed their visas or were never documented due to the actions of their parents. DACA can provide assistance to those who are facing deportation or removal proceedings, as well as individuals who wish to remain in the U.S. for employment purposes. \nDACA is a type of discretionary relief, which means that it is not automatically granted, and it can be revoked at any time. It is also important to understand that DACA does not give young immigrants lawful status in the United States. Instead, it is an acknowledgment from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) that actions to remove the applicant will be delayed for two years, with renewals possible. Those granted relief under DACA are also usually eligible to get a work permit and a Social Security number, which is often helpful in finding a job and obtaining a driver’s license. \nEligibility Requirements for DACA\nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we know that the immigration laws of the United States can be complex and confusing. Unfortunately, the guidelines that pertain to DACA are no different. However, the criteria for applying for DACA relief are relatively straightforward. If you wish to apply for relief under DACA, all of the following must be true:\n\nYou came to the United States before your 16th birthday.\nYou were not older than 30 on June 15, 2012 (the date the DACA executive order took effect).\nYou have never been convicted of a felony or a significant misdemeanor.\nYou graduated high school, obtained a GED, are still in school, or are a veteran of the U.S. armed forces.\nYou have lived in the United States since June 15, 2007.\nYou had no legal immigration status as of June 15, 2012.\n\nYou must also be at least 15 years old at the time of your application, unless you are currently facing removal proceedings or a final removal or voluntary departure order has been issued.\nProtecting Your Best Interests in North Carolina\nThe knowledgeable lawyers at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC have over 35 years of combined immigration law experience. We realize the DACA relief does not change your immigration status, nor does it allow you to stay in the U.S. indefinitely. Instead, it gives you additional time to figure out how to remain in the United States legally. Depending on your situation, you may be able to seek a family-based immigrant visa, which in turn, could allow you to apply for lawful permanent resident (green card) status. Our attorneys can help with your application for DACA, as well as any necessary follow-up action so that you can enjoy the full benefits of living in the United States legally.\nWe Are Here to Help You\nFor the most up-to-date information about the availability of relief through DACA, or for help getting your application started, contact our office. Call  or 919-626-8450 to schedule a free consultation at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC today. We serve clients in Charlotte, Smithfield, Raleigh, Mecklenburg County, Johnston County, Wake County, and the surrounding communities.
