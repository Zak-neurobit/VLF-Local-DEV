The word “removal,” however, often creates far less of an emotional reaction, even though the two terms mean the exact same thing. When immigration officials order a non-U.S. citizen to leave the country, the process of forcing him or her to leave is known as proceedings for removal. A foreign national could be subject to deportation or removal for a variety of reasons, but the process is usually prompted by the non-citizen committing some type of violation of U.S. laws.\nAt Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our immigration lawyers know that any person who is in the United States and who is not a full U.S. citizen is always at some risk of being deported. Once removed, an immigrant may need to wait up to ten years before he or she can return to the United States, if his or her return is permitted at all. Our experienced immigration lawyers understand the effect that deportation can have on a person’s loved ones, and we are prepared to assist any individual who is facing potential removal.\nCommon Reasons for Removal Proceedings\nDefending against removal proceedings at immigration removal centres can be complicated, and the best way to build a defense will depend on a number of factors. Among these are the history of the individual and the reasons that the government is pushing for deportation. For example, a person could be subject to removal because of:\n\nA visitor or non-immigrant visa that is expired\nA conviction on criminal charges, especially a serious criminal offense\nA finding that he or she came to the United States illegally\nA revocation of the person’s conditional resident status\n\nNo matter what the circumstances are that prompted deportation proceedings against you, the team at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC believes that you deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Our immigration lawyers know how difficult the various aspects of U.S. immigration law can be, we understand how high the stakes are when you are facing the possibility of deportation. We will do everything we can to help you or your family member avoid removal and stay in the U.S. legally.\nDefending Against Deportation in Johnston County\nThe moment you receive a Notice to Appear of board of immigration appeals in regard to a potential removal, you need a qualified immigration lawyer immediately. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our lawyers have more than 35 years of combined legal experience, and we are equipped to help you protect your rights at every stage of the proceedings.\nThe best course of action will depend on the unique circumstances of your case. Our attorneys are ready and willing to help you pursue:\n\nAdjustment of status: If you are currently a conditional resident or a visitor to the U.S., you might qualify for an adjustment of status through which you could get your green card. Lawful permanent residents are usually less likely to be removed.\nAsylum: If your removal would force you to go back to a country where you would be persecuted due to your religion, gender, race, political affiliation, or other reasons, you could pursue asylum and potentially be allowed to stay in the U.S.\nCancellation of removal: For immigration reform Removal proceedings may be terminated if you show that you have lived in the U.S. for ten years or more, you have strong moral character, and your being removed would cause a qualifying permanent resident or U.S. citizen undue hardship.\n\nIn some cases, avoiding removal is not possible. If this is the situation for you, our lawyers will help you understand your options for leaving the United States on your own rather than being forcibly removed. By doing so, you could facilitate a quicker return to the U.S. than is usually permitted if you were taken into custody and removed involuntarily.\nWe Are Ready to Help You\nIf you or someone you love is in danger of being deported, contact our office right away.

The word “removal,” however, often creates far less of an emotional reaction, even though the two terms mean the exact same thing. When immigration officials order a non-U.S. citizen to leave the country, the process of forcing him or her to leave is known as proceedings for removal. A foreign national could be subject to deportation or removal for a variety of reasons, but the process is usually prompted by the non-citizen committing some type of violation of U.S. laws.\nAt Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our immigration lawyers know that any person who is in the United States and who is not a full U.S. citizen is always at some risk of being deported. Once removed, an immigrant may need to wait up to ten years before he or she can return to the United States, if his or her return is permitted at all. Our experienced immigration lawyers understand the effect that deportation can have on a person’s loved ones, and we are prepared to assist any individual who is facing potential removal.\nCommon Reasons for Removal Proceedings\nDefending against removal proceedings at immigration removal centres can be complicated, and the best way to build a defense will depend on a number of factors. Among these are the history of the individual and the reasons that the government is pushing for deportation. For example, a person could be subject to removal because of:\n\nA visitor or non-immigrant visa that is expired\nA conviction on criminal charges, especially a serious criminal offense\nA finding that he or she came to the United States illegally\nA revocation of the person’s conditional resident status\n\nNo matter what the circumstances are that prompted deportation proceedings against you, the team at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC believes that you deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Our immigration lawyers know how difficult the various aspects of U.S. immigration law can be, we understand how high the stakes are when you are facing the possibility of deportation. We will do everything we can to help you or your family member avoid removal and stay in the U.S. legally.\nDefending Against Deportation in Johnston County\nThe moment you receive a Notice to Appear of board of immigration appeals in regard to a potential removal, you need a qualified immigration lawyer immediately. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our lawyers have more than 35 years of combined legal experience, and we are equipped to help you protect your rights at every stage of the proceedings.\nThe best course of action will depend on the unique circumstances of your case. Our attorneys are ready and willing to help you pursue:\n\nAdjustment of status: If you are currently a conditional resident or a visitor to the U.S., you might qualify for an adjustment of status through which you could get your green card. Lawful permanent residents are usually less likely to be removed.\nAsylum: If your removal would force you to go back to a country where you would be persecuted due to your religion, gender, race, political affiliation, or other reasons, you could pursue asylum and potentially be allowed to stay in the U.S.\nCancellation of removal: For immigration reform Removal proceedings may be terminated if you show that you have lived in the U.S. for ten years or more, you have strong moral character, and your being removed would cause a qualifying permanent resident or U.S. citizen undue hardship.\n\nIn some cases, avoiding removal is not possible. If this is the situation for you, our lawyers will help you understand your options for leaving the United States on your own rather than being forcibly removed. By doing so, you could facilitate a quicker return to the U.S. than is usually permitted if you were taken into custody and removed involuntarily.\nWe Are Ready to Help You\nIf you or someone you love is in danger of being deported, contact our office right away. Call  or 919-626-8450 to schedule an immigration lawyer free consultation at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC today.
