Foreign nationals coming from other countries to the U.S. are often unaware of how various factors could affect their ability to stay in the United States legally. These same factors could even impact their immigration status overall. For many would-be immigrants, a common issue is being charged with or convicted of a crime. Those who are here legally, as well as undocumented immigrants, frequently fail to consider that being convicted on many types of criminal charges could cause immigration officials to initiate removal and deportation proceedings.\nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our immigration attorneys have vast experience in both matters of immigration and criminal defense. With more than 35 years of combined legal experience, we have the knowledge, skills, and resources to help non-citizens throughout the region protect their best interests, their rights, and their immigration status in the United States.\nHow Criminal Prosecution Could Affect Immigration Status\nAs a non-U.S. citizen, if you are convicted of committing a crime, your immigration court case status and ability to stay legally in the U.S. could be affected. This is true even if you are a lawful permanent resident—also known as a green card holder. The particular consequences associated with your case, however, will depend on a host of different factors, including but not limited to:\n\nYour current immigration status, e.g., lawful permanent resident, non-immigrant visa holder, etc.\nHow long you have been living in the U.S.\nThe severity and nature of the criminal charges that you are facing\nYour prior criminal record, if any, including past immigration law violations\n\nIn most criminal cases, the prosecuting immigration lawyer will offer a plea bargain, ostensibly to reduce charges against the suspect, as well as the associated penalties. If you are a non-citizen foreign national, however, you need to keep in mind that a plea deal generally requires you to plead guilty to some type of criminal offense. A guilty plea, in most situations, will have the same effects as a conviction handed down by a judge or jury. With this in mind, you must know if your immigration status is in danger before you accept any deals offered by prosecutors. Once a plea deal has been accepted and the judgment has been entered, it is too late to change your mind.\nJohnston County Counsel for Non-Citizens in Criminal Matters\nWhen you are facing charges related to a deportable offense, it is crucial to work with a law firm that is well-versed in both criminal law and U.S. immigration policies. The attorneys at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC have helped many non-U.S. citizens throughout Wake County and the surrounding areas with their most complex criminal cases, and we have obtained many favorable results. We know that a conviction could result in your deportation—an outcome that could have devastating effects on your family. Our lawyers understand the stakes, and we will do all we can to assist you in avoiding a conviction and protecting your right to remain in the United States legally. Our goal is to help clients avoid convictions that could lead to deportation, as deportation often has lasting effects on first-generation immigrant families and their future in the United States.\n \nAt our firm, we are also prepared to help non-citizens who have already been convicted of a deportable offense. We will review the details of your case and explain your available options, which may include getting the judgment vacated or demonstrating to immigration officials that you should be allowed to remain in the U.S. despite your conviction. No matter how serious your situation may be, we are committed to helping you protect your best interests at every stage of the proceedings.\nWe Are Ready to Help You\nTo learn more about our firm and our approach to criminal cases that could affect your immigration court case status, contact our office.

Foreign nationals coming from other countries to the U.S. are often unaware of how various factors could affect their ability to stay in the United States legally. These same factors could even impact their immigration status overall. For many would-be immigrants, a common issue is being charged with or convicted of a crime. Those who are here legally, as well as undocumented immigrants, frequently fail to consider that being convicted on many types of criminal charges could cause immigration officials to initiate removal and deportation proceedings.\nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our immigration attorneys have vast experience in both matters of immigration and criminal defense. With more than 35 years of combined legal experience, we have the knowledge, skills, and resources to help non-citizens throughout the region protect their best interests, their rights, and their immigration status in the United States.\nHow Criminal Prosecution Could Affect Immigration Status\nAs a non-U.S. citizen, if you are convicted of committing a crime, your immigration court case status and ability to stay legally in the U.S. could be affected. This is true even if you are a lawful permanent resident—also known as a green card holder. The particular consequences associated with your case, however, will depend on a host of different factors, including but not limited to:\n\nYour current immigration status, e.g., lawful permanent resident, non-immigrant visa holder, etc.\nHow long you have been living in the U.S.\nThe severity and nature of the criminal charges that you are facing\nYour prior criminal record, if any, including past immigration law violations\n\nIn most criminal cases, the prosecuting immigration lawyer will offer a plea bargain, ostensibly to reduce charges against the suspect, as well as the associated penalties. If you are a non-citizen foreign national, however, you need to keep in mind that a plea deal generally requires you to plead guilty to some type of criminal offense. A guilty plea, in most situations, will have the same effects as a conviction handed down by a judge or jury. With this in mind, you must know if your immigration status is in danger before you accept any deals offered by prosecutors. Once a plea deal has been accepted and the judgment has been entered, it is too late to change your mind.\nJohnston County Counsel for Non-Citizens in Criminal Matters\nWhen you are facing charges related to a deportable offense, it is crucial to work with a law firm that is well-versed in both criminal law and U.S. immigration policies. The attorneys at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC have helped many non-U.S. citizens throughout Wake County and the surrounding areas with their most complex criminal cases, and we have obtained many favorable results. We know that a conviction could result in your deportation—an outcome that could have devastating effects on your family. Our lawyers understand the stakes, and we will do all we can to assist you in avoiding a conviction and protecting your right to remain in the United States legally. Our goal is to help clients avoid convictions that could lead to deportation, as deportation often has lasting effects on first-generation immigrant families and their future in the United States.\n \nAt our firm, we are also prepared to help non-citizens who have already been convicted of a deportable offense. We will review the details of your case and explain your available options, which may include getting the judgment vacated or demonstrating to immigration officials that you should be allowed to remain in the U.S. despite your conviction. No matter how serious your situation may be, we are committed to helping you protect your best interests at every stage of the proceedings.\nWe Are Ready to Help You\nTo learn more about our firm and our approach to criminal cases that could affect your immigration court case status, contact our office.
