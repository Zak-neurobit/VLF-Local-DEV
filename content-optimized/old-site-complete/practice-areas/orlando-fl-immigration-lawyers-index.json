The United States is a great place to live, and it affords many people from around the world the kind of happiness they wouldn’t have found otherwise. However, the process of coming to the U.S. can be fraught. The legal system is complicated, and there are many barriers to entry that can make your goals seem downright impossible. With the help of our <a href=\"../index.html\">Orlando immigration lawyers</a>, however, you have the opportunity to make all your dreams a reality.</p>\n<p>The lawyers of Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, have spent over 40 years helping people make a better life in the U.S. We want to help you demystify the immigration process so you can find success and happiness here. Reach out to schedule a free initial consultation and learn more about how we can be your legal champions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How Our Orlando Immigration Lawyers Can Help You</strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to immigration, there are no shortage of goals you might have in mind or challenges you might find yourself facing. Our Orlando immigration lawyers have experience helping clients in a variety of areas including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html\"><strong>Visas</strong></a>: Whether you are looking to come to the U.S. permanently or temporarily, a visa needs to be the first step on your journey. There are many different kinds of visas, so if you experience confusion over which one is right for you, our firm can help you choose and put together a clean, effective application.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/green-card\"><strong>Green cards</strong></a>: When you want to become a citizen of the United States, getting a green card is the first step. A green card is an important step for people who want to live and work in the U.S. since it gives you permanent residency status, which means that you can legally work, obtain documentation such as a driver’s license, and sponsor your spouse and children for green cards of their own. Vasquez Law Firm can help you with your application as well as ensure that there are no issues with your sponsorship or eligibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../north-carolina-attorney/if-i-am-convicted-of-a-crime-will-i-get-deported.html\"><strong>Deportation appeals</strong></a>: Removal proceedings happen for many reasons, such as a visa expiring or as a consequence of criminal activity. If you are in removal proceedings, our firm can act fast to make sure you are given a fighting chance of staying in the U.S. If you have already been ordered to be deported, we can submit an appeal so that you can have another shot at staying here.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../north-carolina-attorney/what-are-the-requirements-for-adjustment-of-status-for-immigrants.html\"><strong>Adjustment of status</strong></a>: If you are facing deportation or ready to make the jump from visa to green card, we can help you adjust your status.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/DACA\"><strong>DACA</strong></a>: The Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Act gives legal status to people who arrived in the U.S. in childhood. Through DACA, Dreamers are able to have access to key documentation, like a driver’s license and social security card, as well as the right to legally work and live in the U.S. without fear of deportation. If you want to apply for DACA, we can help you determine your eligibility and submit a clean application.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Criminal offenses</strong>: Criminal convictions can come with consequences for your immigration status, not the least of which is deportation! In addition to immigration issues, Vasquez Law Firm is also a practice for defending against criminal offenses. As “crimmigration” lawyers, we can help you defend yourself against criminal charges and fight to stay here in the U.S.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Naturalization</strong>: When you are ready to become a naturalized citizen, congratulations! We can help you throughout the process of forms, tests, interviews, and ceremonies in order to cross this important milestone!</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, Can Help You Achieve Your Immigration Goals</strong></p>\n<p>Immigration laws are constantly changing.
