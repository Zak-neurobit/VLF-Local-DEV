Nonetheless, when you are trying to claim compensation for your injuries and damages to your property, there are certain efforts you want to make immediately following the crash and beyond. If you are able to collect as much documentation as possible, you have a better chance of being granted the proper damages to which you are entitled down the line.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawyers of Vasquez Law Firm have compiled a list of types of evidence that can be used to support your claim for compensation in the event that you get into an auto accident. If you are able, collect and keep track of this evidence as thoroughly as possible in order to maximize your claim.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Photos And Videos&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following an accident, you want to document the scene, assuming your injuries do not prevent you from doing so. If you are conscious and can do so without aggravating your injuries, take as many photos and videos as possible of the accident, including damage to your vehicle, skid marks on the road, the position of the cars, street signs, weather conditions, debris, and license plates. Also take photos of any injuries on yourself and your passengers that are immediately apparent.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-dash-cam/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dash cam</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a useful tool for any time you are on the road, and they are especially useful in the event of an accident. If you have a dash cam that documented the accident, make sure to back up the file and distribute it to your lawyer.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on where the accident occurred, such as in front businesses or homes with cameras, your lawyer might also be able to request surveillance video that happened to capture the accident, which can lend credence to your testimony regarding who was at fault.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Police Reports</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you get into an accident, your first move should be contacting police and medical assistance. When authorities arrive on the scene, they will take your statement and the statement of the other driver, and their report will include information such as the location of the crash, the time, and any tickets issued to either party. Access to the police report is especially important when working with insurance companies because police are regarded as authoritative, unbiased sources on accident information.</span></p>\n<p><b>Medical Records</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you get into an accident, always call for an ambulance and have your injuries evaluated even if you feel that you have not been significantly injured. In some cases, the shock from the accident can delay the pain from your injuries, and you might even exacerbate the damage to yourself. In other cases, you might be suffering internal injuries that can cause problems down the line.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, it’s important to have your injuries assessed immediately because medical records are an important part of your claim. If you wait to receive medical attention, your insurance company might argue that you did not sustain your injuries as a direct result of the accident. Keep the records of your medical expenses as well as thorough documentation of the care that you received including surgery, medication, scans, and so on.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Important to note is that if you receive mental health treatment related to trauma, depression, or anxiety because of your accident, you can likewise be entitled to damages for these issues.</span></p>\n<p><b>Witness Statements</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Statements from people who witnessed your accident can help corroborate your version of events. If you feel able to do so, speak to anyone who stopped to assist you in your accident, get their names and contact information, and have your lawyer reach out to them for their recollection of the accident.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, police records might note any people who were able to give their eyewitness reports, in which case your lawyer can try to reach out to them through the information available in the report.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Expert Testimony</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Likewise, experts ranging from accident reconstruction specialists to medical professionals can offer their analyses on the specifics of your accident and the extent of your injuries. Psychology professionals can also testify regarding the trauma and emotional damage the accident has inflicted.</span></p>\n<p><b>Property Damage Records</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides yourself, there are many material objects that can be damaged in an auto accident and for which you should be compensated. An obvious one is your vehicle. If your car is too damaged to be fixed, you should be compensated for the new one, so be sure to keep your receipts. Otherwise, keep similar documentation on the cost to fix your car as well as the cost of obtaining a rental car for travel in the meantime.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other property in your vehicle, such as clothing that might be ripped or splashed with blood, eyeglasses that are broken, phones that are damaged, and more can be part of your claim. If you have to replace any broken possessions as part of your accident, speak with your attorney about the prices of your valuables.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pay Stubs And Employment Records</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you lost wages at your job due to your accident or you have a diminished earning capacity because of your injury, you should collect your pay stubs, records of your work absences, as well as records of any other losses such as if you missed out on a pay increase or other advancement due to your lack of attendance. Your lawyer will work with you to assess the economic damage that you have suffered and request the proper compensation.</span></p>\n<p><b>Vasquez Law Firm Can Help With Any Of Your Auto Accident Claims</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For over 40 years, Vasquez Law Firm has been helping our clients seek the compensation they deserve in auto accident claims.
