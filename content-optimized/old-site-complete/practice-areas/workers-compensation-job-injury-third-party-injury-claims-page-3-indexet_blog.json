    "ogDescription": "Lawyers in Wake County Helping With Personal Injury Lawsuits for Workplace Accidents According to information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 73,000 North Carolina private-industry workers suffer non-fatal workplace injuries and illnesses each year. This number does not include the thousands of other injuries suffered by public-sector—or government—workers annually. In an average year, well over 40,000 cases required the workers in question to miss work, be transferred to a different job, or be placed on restricted duty. At Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we know the effects that a workplace injury can have on your life. In most such cases, you are likely to be eligible for workers’ compensation benefits under the North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act. However, workers’ comp benefits are not always sufficient to restore your life to where it once was. If a party other than your employer is responsible for the injuries that you have suffered—even in part—it may be in your best interest to pursue a third-party personal injury claim in addition to your claim with the state’s work comp system. A personal injury lawsuit might also be necessary if you are not eligible for workers’ compensation benefits. Skilled Counsel for North Carolina Workplace […]",

This number does not include the thousands of other injuries suffered by public-sector—or government—workers annually. In an average year, well over 40,000 cases required the workers in question to miss work, be transferred to a different job, or be placed on restricted duty. </p>\n<p>At <a href=\"../../../../attorneys.html\">Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC</a>, we know the effects that a workplace injury can have on your life. In most such cases, you are likely to be eligible for <a href=\"../../../../workers-compensation-job-injury.html\">workers’ compensation</a> benefits under the North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act. However, workers’ comp benefits are not always sufficient to restore your life to where it once was. If a party other than your employer is responsible for the injuries that you have suffered—even in part—it may be in your best interest to pursue a third-party personal injury claim in addition to your claim with the state’s work comp system. A personal injury lawsuit might also be necessary if you are not eligible for workers’ compensation benefits. </p>\n<h3>Skilled Counsel for North Carolina Workplace Injury Cases</h3>\n<p>If you have suffered an injury while on the job, North Carolina law specifies that you cannot file a lawsuit against the employer or your coworkers, with very rare exceptions. However, other negligent individuals or entities could potentially be liable for the injuries you have suffered, depending on the situation. For example, if you are employed as an electrician by a company that was subcontracted to work on a new building <a href=\"../../../construction-site-injuries.html\">construction project</a>, the general contractor in charge of the project is responsible for keeping the site reasonably safe. If you are injured while doing your job on the site due to an unsafe working condition, you could file a workers’ compensation claim as well as a third-party claim against the general contractor. A third-party claim could also be appropriate if your employment requires you to drive, and you are involved in a <a href=\"../../../../personal-injury/car-auto-accidents.html\">car crash</a> caused by another driver. </p>\n<h3>Holding the At-Fault Parties Accountable for Work-Related Accidents</h3>\n<p>The knowledgeable personal injury lawyers at Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC have over 35 years of combined experience. We realize that the path toward collecting compensation for you begins with a detailed review of the circumstances of your accident so that we can establish what happened and which party or parties may be liable. Our lawyers will also meet with you to discuss the nature and extent of your injuries and how your life has been affected by them. From there, we will develop a strategy for getting you the workers’ compensation benefits and the third-party compensation you need to put your life back on track. </p>\n<p>When you choose our firm to help with your case, we pledge to communicate openly and honestly with you throughout the process. We will keep you fully informed regarding the progress of your case, including any obstacles or roadblocks that may arise so that you are equipped to make informed decisions as your claims move forward. Our client-focused approach has allowed us to secure favorable results for many injured workers, and we are ready to put our experience to work for you and your family.</p>\n<h3>Schedule a Free Consultation Today</h3>\n<p>If you have questions about filing a third-party personal injury claim along with your workers’ compensation claim, <a href=\"../../../../contact.html\">contact</a> the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC.
