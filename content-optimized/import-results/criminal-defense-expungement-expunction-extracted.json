We know that good people can easily get caught up in bad situations and that a momentary lapse in judgment can have a profound effect on your future. With this in mind, our attorneys are equipped to help you clear your criminal record through a legal process known as expungement or expunction.",
      "Many people assume that the only way to have a criminal record is to be charged and convicted of some type of crime. Unfortunately, such is not the case. The truth is that if you have been arrested on any criminal charge, the arrest becomes a part of your permanent record, even if the charges are eventually dropped or if you are acquitted. Of course, if you are convicted, the conviction goes on your record as well.",
      "The only way to get items removed from your record is through a legal process known as expunction. Also referred to as expungement, expunction means that all records of an eligible arrest—or conviction, as applicable—are permanently destroyed. After you complete the expunction process, you will no longer need to tell anyone, including prospective employers or insurers, that you were arrested or charged with a crime. An expunged record is completely removed from your criminal history and is not visible during a background check.",
      "North Carolina has long permitted the expunction of arrest records for cases that were dismissed or that resulted in acquittals. This means if you were arrested but not convicted, you can apply to have the arrest removed from your record. Recent changes to the law have also made it easier to expunge older, non-violent misdemeanor and felony convictions. If you are looking to expunge a non-violent misdemeanor conviction, such as larceny or underage drinking, you must wait five years to apply. For a non-violent felony, such as drug possession or white-collar offenses, the waiting period is ten years, during which you must not have been convicted of another crime.",
      "It can be quite complicated to remove an arrest or conviction from your record and nearly impossible for you to do so on your own. If you are looking to start over with a proverbial clean slate, it is important to work with a qualified expunction attorney. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our lawyers have helped many clients obtain expungements, and we are ready to put our experience to work for you. We will assist you in determining your eligibility for expunction, as well as with preparing and filing your petition with the court. Our attorneys will ensure that everything is in order and that no details have been overlooked, as a single mistake could derail the entire process.",

    "Everyone makes mistakes from time to time. It is simply part of being human. However, if your mistakes resulted in an arrest or criminal conviction on your record, you could be facing a lifetime of difficulties in a variety of situations. Your record could be a barrier that is preventing you from getting the job you want, the home you need, or even the education necessary to better your life. The good news is that you may have options available to get a fresh start.",
    "At Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our team believes in second chances. We know that good people can easily get caught up in bad situations and that a momentary lapse in judgment can have a profound effect on your future. With this in mind, our attorneys are equipped to help you clear your criminal record through a legal process known as expungement or expunction.",
    "Many people assume that the only way to have a criminal record is to be charged and convicted of some type of crime. Unfortunately, such is not the case. The truth is that if you have been arrested on any criminal charge, the arrest becomes a part of your permanent record, even if the charges are eventually dropped or if you are acquitted. Of course, if you are convicted, the conviction goes on your record as well.",
    "The only way to get items removed from your record is through a legal process known as expunction. Also referred to as expungement, expunction means that all records of an eligible arrest—or conviction, as applicable—are permanently destroyed. After you complete the expunction process, you will no longer need to tell anyone, including prospective employers or insurers, that you were arrested or charged with a crime. An expunged record is completely removed from your criminal history and is not visible during a background check.",
    "North Carolina has long permitted the expunction of arrest records for cases that were dismissed or that resulted in acquittals. This means if you were arrested but not convicted, you can apply to have the arrest removed from your record. Recent changes to the law have also made it easier to expunge older, non-violent misdemeanor and felony convictions. If you are looking to expunge a non-violent misdemeanor conviction, such as larceny or underage drinking, you must wait five years to apply. For a non-violent felony, such as drug possession or white-collar offenses, the waiting period is ten years, during which you must not have been convicted of another crime.",
    "It can be quite complicated to remove an arrest or conviction from your record and nearly impossible for you to do so on your own. If you are looking to start over with a proverbial clean slate, it is important to work with a qualified expunction attorney. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our lawyers have helped many clients obtain expungements, and we are ready to put our experience to work for you. We will assist you in determining your eligibility for expunction, as well as with preparing and filing your petition with the court. Our attorneys will ensure that everything is in order and that no details have been overlooked, as a single mistake could derail the entire process.",
    "To learn more about your eligibility for expunction or to get started on your petition, contact our office. Call 1-844-YO-PELEO or 919-626-8450 for a free, no-obligation consultation at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC today. Our lawyers represent clients in Raleigh, Smithfield, Charlotte, Wake County, Johnston County, Mecklenburg County, and the surrounding communities. Hablamos Espanol.",
