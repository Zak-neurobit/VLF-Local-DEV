  "ogDescription": "Workers’ Compensation Lawyers in Raleigh for Overexertion and Heavy Lifting Injuries Lifting heavy objects is a part of many occupations here in North Carolina. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for lifting and carrying objects to cause workers to suffer serious injuries. In fact, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) ranks heavy lifting among the leading causes of work-related injuries in not only North Carolina but also the entire country. If you have been injured as a result of heavy lifting or overexertion at work, the law in North Carolina provides that you should be eligible to collect benefits through the state’s workers’ compensation program. Collecting those benefits, however, is not always easy. Uncooperative employers and stubborn work comp insurance carriers often make the claims process much more complicated than it needs to be. The good news is that we are here to help. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we have successfully secured workers’ comp benefits for many workers injured due to heavy lifting, and we are ready to put our experience to work for you. How Do Lifting Accidents Happen? There are many factors that can contribute to an employee being hurt while lifting objects at work. […]",

          "Too much weight: Depending on the industry and your specific job, you might regularly be asked to lift loads that are too heavy for one person to handle safely. An object that is too heavy can place tremendous strain on your muscles, your knees, your vertebrae, and your spinal discs. According to OSHA, the risk of injury is significant when a single person attempts to lift loads of 50 pounds or more without a machine or assistance from another worker.",
          "Awkward positions or postures: You have probably been told time and again to lift with your legs and not your back to prevent lifting injuries. When you bend at the waist to lift a heavy load, your back must support all of the load’s weight, which is extremely dangerous. Some situations may also force you to reach while you are lifting a load, such as when you are trying to place a heavy object on a shelf. OSHA recommends keeping heavy loads close to your body and in the “power zone” from the mid-chest to mid-thighs whenever possible.",
          "Repetitive lifting or carrying: Any motion that must be repeated many times each workday can cause repetitive stress injuries. The danger increases when the motion involves lifting or holding a load above chest-level for long periods. In addition to the strain placed on your joints, the lactic acid buildup in your muscles can cause damage. Repetitive lifting of heavy loads can also damage joints, ligaments, and tendons over time."

        "Too much weight: Depending on the industry and your specific job, you might regularly be asked to lift loads that are too heavy for one person to handle safely. An object that is too heavy can place tremendous strain on your muscles, your knees, your vertebrae, and your spinal discs. According to OSHA, the risk of injury is significant when a single person attempts to lift loads of 50 pounds or more without a machine or assistance from another worker.",
        "Awkward positions or postures: You have probably been told time and again to lift with your legs and not your back to prevent lifting injuries. When you bend at the waist to lift a heavy load, your back must support all of the load’s weight, which is extremely dangerous. Some situations may also force you to reach while you are lifting a load, such as when you are trying to place a heavy object on a shelf. OSHA recommends keeping heavy loads close to your body and in the “power zone” from the mid-chest to mid-thighs whenever possible.",
        "Repetitive lifting or carrying: Any motion that must be repeated many times each workday can cause repetitive stress injuries. The danger increases when the motion involves lifting or holding a load above chest-level for long periods. In addition to the strain placed on your joints, the lactic acid buildup in your muscles can cause damage. Repetitive lifting of heavy loads can also damage joints, ligaments, and tendons over time."
