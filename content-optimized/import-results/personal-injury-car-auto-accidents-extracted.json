          "Call 911 – The primary concern after a crash should be the safety of everyone involved. By contacting emergency services, you can get immediate medical attention for those who need it. Your call will also guarantee that an accident report will be filed, which is an essential element if a lawsuit becomes necessary.",
          "Collect information – In most cases, your attorney will not be able to make it to the scene of the crash, so it is up to you to gather as much information as possible. Important information includes contact and insurance info for everyone involved, a list of damages and injuries, and photographs of the accident.",
          "Never admit fault – No matter how the accident happened, do not apologize or accept any part of the blame at the scene. This includes your conversations with the police, bystanders, and other parties. Even a simple apology could potentially damage your claim for compensation.",
          "Seek medical attention – After an accident, it is important to see a doctor, even if you do not think you are seriously hurt. Some injuries may not be apparent to you for a matter of hours or days. Adrenaline can also mask the existence or the severity of your injuries, so you should always get checked out by a medical professional."

Your call will also guarantee that an accident report will be filed, which is an essential element if a lawsuit becomes necessary.",
        "Collect information – In most cases, your attorney will not be able to make it to the scene of the crash, so it is up to you to gather as much information as possible. Important information includes contact and insurance info for everyone involved, a list of damages and injuries, and photographs of the accident.",
        "Never admit fault – No matter how the accident happened, do not apologize or accept any part of the blame at the scene. This includes your conversations with the police, bystanders, and other parties. Even a simple apology could potentially damage your claim for compensation.",

Some injuries may not be apparent to you for a matter of hours or days. Adrenaline can also mask the existence or the severity of your injuries, so you should always get checked out by a medical professional."
