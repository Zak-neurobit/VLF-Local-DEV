      "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our lawyers provide assistance to individuals and families throughout the region with their most complicated immigration concerns. The federal laws that apply to family-based immigration can be complex and confusing, and it can be challenging to understand and meet the law’s requirements. This is why it is so important to work closely with a qualified family-based immigration attorney as you seek to offer a better life and new opportunities to your loved ones. We have the experience, knowledge, and resources to help you obtain the necessary visas for your family members in a variety of circumstances or situations.",
      "The skilled attorneys at our firm have over 35 years of combined experience in handling family-related immigration matters. We know how to anticipate and address potential issues in advance so that they do not become serious obstacles. Our team is dedicated to helping you secure a favorable result for your family member, no matter the challenges that may arise.",
      "The area of family-based immigration encompasses a wide range of cases in which United States citizens and lawful permanent residents (“green card” holders) seek to bring their family members and future spouses to the U.S. legally. According to U.S. immigration law, lawful permanent residents and legal citizens can serve as sponsors to help their relatives obtain permanent or temporary visas.",
      "Generally, the application process for family-based immigration is relatively straightforward. The process begins when a citizen or permanent resident files a completed Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) with the primary immigration agency of the U.S. government: United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, also known as USCIS. Once the petition is accepted by USCIS, the petitioner will be notified of a date after which the family members in question are able to apply for visas or green cards.",
      "The United States government allows for the approval of a limited number of family visas and permanent resident status applications in a given year. Therefore, a preference system has been created for processing family immigration requests. Legal spouses, minor children, and parents of current U.S. citizens over the age of 21 are immediate relatives, which means they are not included in the family preference system.",
      "Applications for other relatives, however, are considered in order based on the status of the petitioner and the relationship:",
      "A family-based immigration petition will not be considered for grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, or in-laws.",
      "If you are a U.S. citizen or green card holder and you are engaged to a foreign national, it may be possible to obtain a K-visa to bring your fiancé to the U.S. so that you can get married. A K-visa might also be helpful if you already married a foreign national abroad but your spouse has not received his or her green card yet. K-visas are commonly called “fiancé visas,” and they are not permanent. Your future spouse’s K-visa can be revoked if you never finalize the marriage or if your marriage is dissolved through divorce or annulment.",
      "Family-based immigration concerns can be complicated, and you may have several options for bringing your relatives or your fiancé to the United States legally. At Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we will meet with you to discuss your situation and to determine the best way to meet your needs. We understand the challenges that you may be facing, and we are equipped to provide the guidance you need at every stage of the immigration process.",

    "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our lawyers provide assistance to individuals and families throughout the region with their most complicated immigration concerns. The federal laws that apply to family-based immigration can be complex and confusing, and it can be challenging to understand and meet the law’s requirements. This is why it is so important to work closely with a qualified family-based immigration attorney as you seek to offer a better life and new opportunities to your loved ones. We have the experience, knowledge, and resources to help you obtain the necessary visas for your family members in a variety of circumstances or situations.",
    "The skilled attorneys at our firm have over 35 years of combined experience in handling family-related immigration matters. We know how to anticipate and address potential issues in advance so that they do not become serious obstacles. Our team is dedicated to helping you secure a favorable result for your family member, no matter the challenges that may arise.",
    "The area of family-based immigration encompasses a wide range of cases in which United States citizens and lawful permanent residents (“green card” holders) seek to bring their family members and future spouses to the U.S. legally. According to U.S. immigration law, lawful permanent residents and legal citizens can serve as sponsors to help their relatives obtain permanent or temporary visas.",
    "Generally, the application process for family-based immigration is relatively straightforward. The process begins when a citizen or permanent resident files a completed Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) with the primary immigration agency of the U.S. government: United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, also known as USCIS. Once the petition is accepted by USCIS, the petitioner will be notified of a date after which the family members in question are able to apply for visas or green cards.",
    "The United States government allows for the approval of a limited number of family visas and permanent resident status applications in a given year. Therefore, a preference system has been created for processing family immigration requests. Legal spouses, minor children, and parents of current U.S. citizens over the age of 21 are immediate relatives, which means they are not included in the family preference system.",
    "Applications for other relatives, however, are considered in order based on the status of the petitioner and the relationship:",
    "A family-based immigration petition will not be considered for grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, or in-laws.",
    "If you are a U.S. citizen or green card holder and you are engaged to a foreign national, it may be possible to obtain a K-visa to bring your fiancé to the U.S. so that you can get married. A K-visa might also be helpful if you already married a foreign national abroad but your spouse has not received his or her green card yet. K-visas are commonly called “fiancé visas,” and they are not permanent. Your future spouse’s K-visa can be revoked if you never finalize the marriage or if your marriage is dissolved through divorce or annulment.",
    "Family-based immigration concerns can be complicated, and you may have several options for bringing your relatives or your fiancé to the United States legally. At Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we will meet with you to discuss your situation and to determine the best way to meet your needs. We understand the challenges that you may be facing, and we are equipped to provide the guidance you need at every stage of the immigration process.",
