      "The streets and roadways of North Carolina do not exclusively belong to cars, trucks, and other motor vehicles. Those who are on foot have the right to use public streets as well. Sadly, many motorists are not as careful and observant as they need to be in regard to nearby pedestrians. Drivers often speed, change lanes erratically, and otherwise fail to drive in a safe and cautious manner. A person can be distracted easily by a cell phone, radio, or GPS device. Even a seemingly mundane conversation with someone in the same vehicle could be a big enough distraction to cause a driver to lose concentration at the wrong time and strike a pedestrian.",
      "Pedestrians can also be injured by drunk drivers or motorists who are under the influence of drugs. An intoxicated driver could drift into a walkway onto a sidewalk without even realizing it. A preoccupied or impaired driver might also struggle to stop in time to avoid a pedestrian who has simply stepped out to cross the street at an intersection.",

      "The accomplished attorneys at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC have more than 35 years of experience helping injured victims put their lives back together. We understand that insurance companies can be extremely frustrating and difficult to work with after an accident that causes injuries. Insurers may be quick to offer a monetary settlement, but a first offer rarely addresses the full extent of what an injured pedestrian has suffered. In addition to the initial treatment in the emergency room, an injured victim may need many surgeries, ongoing physical or occupational therapy, and much more. He or she might also be unable to work for many months or even years. In extreme cases, an injured pedestrian could be left permanently disabled.",
      "When you choose the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC to help with your case, we will handle the insurance companies for you. We will also conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances of your accident so that we can develop a clear understanding of what you will need to move forward. From there, we will negotiate in good faith with the at-fault party or parties, their insurance companies, and their attorneys in an attempt to reach a reasonable agreement. If we cannot agree on a settlement that meets your needs, our team is fully prepared to defend your interests through litigation. You can depend on us to protect your rights every step of the way.",

    "A car accident that involves pedestrians can be absolutely devastating. When a driver makes a careless mistake, pedestrians may suffer severe injuries or even be killed. For those that survive, their lives could be changed forever, as injuries sustained in such an accident can cause life-long problems.",
    "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our compassionate personal injury lawyers understand the challenges that injured pedestrians face in the months and years following an accident. We firmly believe that careless drivers who injure pedestrians need to be held fully accountable for their negligent actions. With this in mind, we work tenaciously on behalf of those who have been hit by cars to get them the full compensation available under the law.",
    "The streets and roadways of North Carolina do not exclusively belong to cars, trucks, and other motor vehicles. Those who are on foot have the right to use public streets as well. Sadly, many motorists are not as careful and observant as they need to be in regard to nearby pedestrians. Drivers often speed, change lanes erratically, and otherwise fail to drive in a safe and cautious manner. A person can be distracted easily by a cell phone, radio, or GPS device. Even a seemingly mundane conversation with someone in the same vehicle could be a big enough distraction to cause a driver to lose concentration at the wrong time and strike a pedestrian.",
    "Pedestrians can also be injured by drunk drivers or motorists who are under the influence of drugs. An intoxicated driver could drift into a walkway onto a sidewalk without even realizing it. A preoccupied or impaired driver might also struggle to stop in time to avoid a pedestrian who has simply stepped out to cross the street at an intersection.",
    "When a pedestrian is hit by a car, he or she is likely to suffer serious injuries. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we help injured pedestrians seek compensation for:",
    "No matter what type of injuries you are dealing with, our team is ready to assist you.",
    "The accomplished attorneys at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC have more than 35 years of experience helping injured victims put their lives back together. We understand that insurance companies can be extremely frustrating and difficult to work with after an accident that causes injuries. Insurers may be quick to offer a monetary settlement, but a first offer rarely addresses the full extent of what an injured pedestrian has suffered. In addition to the initial treatment in the emergency room, an injured victim may need many surgeries, ongoing physical or occupational therapy, and much more. He or she might also be unable to work for many months or even years. In extreme cases, an injured pedestrian could be left permanently disabled.",
    "When you choose the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC to help with your case, we will handle the insurance companies for you. We will also conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances of your accident so that we can develop a clear understanding of what you will need to move forward. From there, we will negotiate in good faith with the at-fault party or parties, their insurance companies, and their attorneys in an attempt to reach a reasonable agreement. If we cannot agree on a settlement that meets your needs, our team is fully prepared to defend your interests through litigation. You can depend on us to protect your rights every step of the way.",
    "If you or a family member suffered injuries in a pedestrian accident, contact our firm for help.
