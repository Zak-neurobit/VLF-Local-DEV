Frustratingly, however, there are barriers in place that might prevent you from getting the payment you deserve. Having to fight for damages on top of recovering from a debilitating injury is something no one should have to deal with! This is why our </span><a href=\"../../index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winston-Salem workers’ comp lawyers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are determined to help you if you have been put in this stressful position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Vasquez Law Firm, we have over 40 years of combined experience ensuring our clients get the payment they are owed for workplace negligence. Employers and insurance companies concerned about their bottom line might try to take advantage of you, but you have legal recourse! Reach out to schedule a free initial consultation and we will begin the process of challenging their attempts to undermine what you deserve.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Understanding Workplace Injuries</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workplace injuries are more common than you might expect. A lot of people imagine that workers’ comp is only relevant to places that do construction or factories or places that otherwise work with heavy equipment. While these types of jobs are more likely to incur workplace injuries, the truth is that accidents can happen anywhere and any workplace can be negligent!&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To better understand how workplace injuries occur, here are some of the more common ones we have seen in our practice:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Overexertion and heavy lifting</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: In jobs that require a lot of manual labor, trying to lift heavy objects that are over your weight limit or lifting them incorrectly can result in injury. These types of workplace injuries are among the most common!</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Repetitive motion injuries</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Even the simplest repetitive motions can cause strain and eventually lead to permanent injury. Even if you are working at a desk, repeating the same motion too many times can lead to issues like carpal tunnel. Even positioning your wrist incorrectly for long periods of time can have significant health implications over time!</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Equipment-related injuries</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There are many dangers inherent in workplaces that concern heavy machinery. Basic negligence can be a huge risk. Machines can malfunction for many reasons, including improper maintenance, poor design, chemical corrosion, and improper usage, all of which put associated workers in danger.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"../../north-carolina-attorney/how-can-i-get-compensation-for-a-construction-site-injury-in-north-carolina.html\"><b>Construction site injuries</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Working at a construction site has many risks, including those associated with equipment-related injuries. If your machinery is defective or improperly maintained, you could be seriously injured. On construction sites, you also have to worry about danger from falls, explosions, and structural collapses.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Mental health impairment</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you have an injury covered by workers’ comp, the associated mental stresses that you have undergone also deserve compensation! After being injured, it’s common to experience depression, anxiety, or PTSD, and your workers’ comp claim should address these issues in addition to your injuries.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>How Our Winston-Salem Workers’ Comp Lawyers Can Make A Difference</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though legally you are entitled to workers’ comp in the event of a workplace injury, employers and insurance companies might conspire to cheat you. They might find incidental reasons to deny your claim or pay you less than what you are owed, hoping that if you accept their initial payment, you can be refused for any additional payments later on.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If companies want to choose their bottom line over the wellbeing of your employees, our Winston-Salem workers’ comp lawyers can help fight back. We will protect you from predatory practices while you are vulnerable and pursue the full amount you are owed, taking pressure off you at a time where healing is crucial.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><b>Vasquez Law Firm Will Seek Just Compensation</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Vasquez Law Firm, we believe in justice. We have 40 years of experience helping clients get the compensation packages that will help them make a full recovery! If you are suffering due to a workplace injury, reach out to </span><a href=\"../../contact.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">schedule a free initial consultation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and we will get to know you and your circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2>\n<p><b>Will a medical report be helpful in my workers’ comp claim?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely.

Frustratingly, however, there are barriers in place that might prevent you from getting the payment you deserve. Having to fight for damages on top of recovering from a debilitating injury is something no one should have to deal with! This is why our </span><a href=\"../../index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winston-Salem workers’ comp lawyers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are determined to help you if you have been put in this stressful position.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Vasquez Law Firm, we have over 40 years of combined experience ensuring our clients get the payment they are owed for workplace negligence. Employers and insurance companies concerned about their bottom line might try to take advantage of you, but you have legal recourse! Reach out to schedule a free initial consultation and we will begin the process of challenging their attempts to undermine what you deserve.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Understanding Workplace Injuries</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workplace injuries are more common than you might expect. A lot of people imagine that workers’ comp is only relevant to places that do construction or factories or places that otherwise work with heavy equipment. While these types of jobs are more likely to incur workplace injuries, the truth is that accidents can happen anywhere and any workplace can be negligent!&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To better understand how workplace injuries occur, here are some of the more common ones we have seen in our practice:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Overexertion and heavy lifting</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: In jobs that require a lot of manual labor, trying to lift heavy objects that are over your weight limit or lifting them incorrectly can result in injury. These types of workplace injuries are among the most common!</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Repetitive motion injuries</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Even the simplest repetitive motions can cause strain and eventually lead to permanent injury. Even if you are working at a desk, repeating the same motion too many times can lead to issues like carpal tunnel. Even positioning your wrist incorrectly for long periods of time can have significant health implications over time!</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Equipment-related injuries</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There are many dangers inherent in workplaces that concern heavy machinery. Basic negligence can be a huge risk. Machines can malfunction for many reasons, including improper maintenance, poor design, chemical corrosion, and improper usage, all of which put associated workers in danger.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"../../north-carolina-attorney/how-can-i-get-compensation-for-a-construction-site-injury-in-north-carolina.html\"><b>Construction site injuries</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Working at a construction site has many risks, including those associated with equipment-related injuries. If your machinery is defective or improperly maintained, you could be seriously injured. On construction sites, you also have to worry about danger from falls, explosions, and structural collapses.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Mental health impairment</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you have an injury covered by workers’ comp, the associated mental stresses that you have undergone also deserve compensation! After being injured, it’s common to experience depression, anxiety, or PTSD, and your workers’ comp claim should address these issues in addition to your injuries.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>How Our Winston-Salem Workers’ Comp Lawyers Can Make A Difference</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though legally you are entitled to workers’ comp in the event of a workplace injury, employers and insurance companies might conspire to cheat you. They might find incidental reasons to deny your claim or pay you less than what you are owed, hoping that if you accept their initial payment, you can be refused for any additional payments later on.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If companies want to choose their bottom line over the wellbeing of your employees, our Winston-Salem workers’ comp lawyers can help fight back. We will protect you from predatory practices while you are vulnerable and pursue the full amount you are owed, taking pressure off you at a time where healing is crucial.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><b>Vasquez Law Firm Will Seek Just Compensation</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Vasquez Law Firm, we believe in justice. We have 40 years of experience helping clients get the compensation packages that will help them make a full recovery! If you are suffering due to a workplace injury, reach out to </span><a href=\"../../contact.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">schedule a free initial consultation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and we will get to know you and your circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2>\n<p><b>Will a medical report be helpful in my workers’ comp claim?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Absolutely. Having professional notes and diagnostics can only help support your claim, and it’s best that you document these as thoroughly as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Can I get compensation for an old injury?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Potentially. There are certain time limits when it comes to seeking compensation for an old injury, but our workers’ comp lawyer can help walk you through your options.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>How long do I have to report my accident to my employer?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Report your injury to your employer no later than 30 days.</span></p></div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div><div class=\"et_pb_column et_pb_column_1_3 et_pb_column_1  et_pb_css_mix_blend_mode_passthrough et-last-child\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"et_pb_with_border et_pb_module dsm_menu dsm_menu_0  et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"et_pb_module_inner\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"dsm-menu-title et_pb_module_header\">Practice Areas</h4><nav class=\"dsm-menu-container\" role=\"navigation\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/SiteNavigationElement\"><ul id=\"menu-winston-salem-nc\" class=\"dsm-menu dsm-menu-style-type-none dsm-menu-layout-vertical dsm-menu-animation dsm-menu-animation-left-right\"><li id=\"menu-item-2697\" class=\"et_pb_menu_page_id-2688 menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-2697\"><a href=\"../winston-salem-nc-auto-accident-lawyers/index.html\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Winston-Salem, NC Auto Accident Lawyers</span></a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-2698\" class=\"et_pb_menu_page_id-2685 menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page menu-item-2698\"><a href=\"../winston-salem-nc-immigration-lawyers/index.html\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Winston-Salem, NC Immigration Lawyers</span></a></li>\n<li id=\"menu-item-3087\" class=\"et_pb_menu_page_id-3080 menu-item menu-item-type-post_type menu-item-object-page current-menu-item page_item page-item-3080 current_page_item menu-item-3087\"><a href=\"index.html\" aria-current=\"page\" itemprop=\"url\"><span itemprop=\"name\">Winston-Salem, NC Workers’ Comp Lawyers</span></a></li>\n</ul></nav>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t</article>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n",
