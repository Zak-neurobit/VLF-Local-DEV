So much so that our goal as </span><a href=\"../../index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winston-Salem immigration lawyers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to help good people come here from overseas and achieve their dreams as fully naturalized American citizens!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The legal team at Vasquez Law Firm has a combined 40 years of experience helping people navigate the complicated legal system that allows for immigration to the U.S. While there are many aspects to love about this country, the barriers of entry can prove very frustrating for people looking to build their new life here. Reach out to us to schedule a free initial consultation and learn how we can help clarify the process and make sure that you are making all of the right moves!</span></p>\n<p><b>Our Winston-Salem Immigration Lawyers Can Help You With Your Immigration Goals</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Visas</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you are looking to stay in the U.S. either temporarily or permanently, you will need a visa. There are many types of visas and each one has a specific function and process by which they can be attained. We can help you ensure that you are pursuing the correct visa and that your paperwork is spotless!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Green cards</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A green card is the first step in the process to naturalization and it allows you to do things in the U.S. like work and help family members come over. In order to procure a green card, you will need sponsorship from a U.S.-based family member or employer. Our Winston-Salem immigration lawyers can help you start the process!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Deportation appeals</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Removal proceedings can happen for a number of reasons, including an expiration of your visa or green card. Deportation can also be used as a penalty for criminal activity. If you are being subject to removal proceedings, we can help you try to adjust your status in order to bypass the removal, or else we can advise you on how you can legally return to the U.S. at a later date.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Adjustment of status</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Do you have a visa and want to upgrade to a green card? We can help you!&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>DACA</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Act allows undocumented children who grew up in the U.S. to have some legal basis in which they can acquire documentation and work in the U.S., as well as be protected from removal proceedings. If you meet the requirements for DACA, we can help you throughout the processes of application and renewal.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Criminal offenses</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Removal proceedings can be a consequence of criminal conviction if you are in the U.S. on a visa or green card. We are “crimmigration” lawyers, meaning we have an extensive background in criminal law in addition to immigration. If you are charged with a crime, we can help defend you from your charges and potentially avoid removal proceedings.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Naturalization</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Naturalization is an equivalent of citizenship, and it is the end goal of many people who are entering the U.S. If it is your dream to live in America, we hope that you will allow us to help you to achieve your dream!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Vasquez Law Firm Can Help You Achieve Your American Dream</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are facing any of these legal struggles related to immigration, the experienced team at Vasquez Law Firm wants to help you overcome your struggles and realize your dreams.

So much so that our goal as </span><a href=\"../../index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Winston-Salem immigration lawyers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is to help good people come here from overseas and achieve their dreams as fully naturalized American citizens!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The legal team at Vasquez Law Firm has a combined 40 years of experience helping people navigate the complicated legal system that allows for immigration to the U.S. While there are many aspects to love about this country, the barriers of entry can prove very frustrating for people looking to build their new life here. Reach out to us to schedule a free initial consultation and learn how we can help clarify the process and make sure that you are making all of the right moves!</span></p>\n<p><b>Our Winston-Salem Immigration Lawyers Can Help You With Your Immigration Goals</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Visas</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you are looking to stay in the U.S. either temporarily or permanently, you will need a visa. There are many types of visas and each one has a specific function and process by which they can be attained. We can help you ensure that you are pursuing the correct visa and that your paperwork is spotless!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Green cards</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A green card is the first step in the process to naturalization and it allows you to do things in the U.S. like work and help family members come over. In order to procure a green card, you will need sponsorship from a U.S.-based family member or employer. Our Winston-Salem immigration lawyers can help you start the process!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Deportation appeals</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Removal proceedings can happen for a number of reasons, including an expiration of your visa or green card. Deportation can also be used as a penalty for criminal activity. If you are being subject to removal proceedings, we can help you try to adjust your status in order to bypass the removal, or else we can advise you on how you can legally return to the U.S. at a later date.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Adjustment of status</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Do you have a visa and want to upgrade to a green card? We can help you!&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>DACA</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Act allows undocumented children who grew up in the U.S. to have some legal basis in which they can acquire documentation and work in the U.S., as well as be protected from removal proceedings. If you meet the requirements for DACA, we can help you throughout the processes of application and renewal.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Criminal offenses</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Removal proceedings can be a consequence of criminal conviction if you are in the U.S. on a visa or green card. We are “crimmigration” lawyers, meaning we have an extensive background in criminal law in addition to immigration. If you are charged with a crime, we can help defend you from your charges and potentially avoid removal proceedings.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Naturalization</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Naturalization is an equivalent of citizenship, and it is the end goal of many people who are entering the U.S. If it is your dream to live in America, we hope that you will allow us to help you to achieve your dream!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Vasquez Law Firm Can Help You Achieve Your American Dream</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are facing any of these legal struggles related to immigration, the experienced team at Vasquez Law Firm wants to help you overcome your struggles and realize your dreams.
