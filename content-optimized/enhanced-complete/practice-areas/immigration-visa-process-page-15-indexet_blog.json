We understand that the process of obtaining a visa can be difficult and time-consuming, and a single mistake along the way could be devastating to the applicant’s case. With this in mind, we provide trusted guidance and skilled representation to both applicants and sponsors throughout the visa process.</p>\n<h3>Non-immigrant and Immigrant Visas</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foreign nationals who wish to come to the United States for an extended period of time must obtain a visa. Temporary, or non-immigrant visas, are available to those coming to the U.S. for reasons such as tourism, education, or work-related purposes. For those who want to remain in the United States permanently, an immigrant visa is required. </span><b>Immigration reform</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are available for employment-based reasons, but the majority of immigrant visas are granted to </span><a href=\"../../../immediate-relative-visas.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">immediate relatives</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and other </span><a href=\"../../../family-based-relative.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">family members</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of U.S. citizens and current </span><a href=\"../../../green-cards.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lawful permanent residents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h3>The Immigrant Visa Process</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most immigrant visa petitions are filed in the United States by U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents (green card holders) who reside here. If you are looking to sponsor a family member’s petition for an </span><b>first generation immigrant</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> visa</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you will need to follow these steps:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure that your family member qualifies for a visa.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gather the information and documents required by Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complete the I-130 package and submit it to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upon receipt of the official notice that USCIS has approved the petition, the State Department’s National Visa Center (NVC) will open a case. If a visa of the requested type is available, an immigrant visa number will be assigned.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complete NVC processing and pay all of the required fees. As part of the NVC processing, you must file an affidavit of support showing that your family member will not need government assistance upon arrival, or you can also get an </span><b>immigration lawyer free consultation</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the processing of your immigrant visa.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have your family member complete an immigrant visa interview at the U.S. embassy or consulate indicated by the NVC.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following the interview, the application for an immigrant visa may be approved. The immigrant visa fee must then be paid.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The visa holder may then travel to the United States and become a lawful permanent resident.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process of obtaining a visa is likely to take between 8 and 16 months, assuming that there is a visa of the appropriate type available. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The importance of understanding the differences between </span><b>emigrate vs immigrating</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and knowing the proper process cannot be understated.</span></p>\n<h3>How Can an Attorney Help?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we understand the challenges that often arise when seeking an immigrant visa. We realize that the requirements set by the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security, and USCIS are strict and, in most cases, non-negotiable.
