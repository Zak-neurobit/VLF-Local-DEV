Each year, some 120,000 victims are sent to the emergency room as the result of crashes in North Carolina. This amounts to about 330 per day, or about one every four and a half minutes. Each one of these victims is faced with rebuilding their lives, to at least some extent, and moving on despite their injuries. </p>\n<p>Fortunately, if you have been injured as the result of another party’s actions or negligence, you may be entitled to compensation to aid in your recovery. Our experienced personal injury attorneys are thorough and knowledgeable professionals who possess the tools to help you seek the justice you deserve.</p>\n<h3>Skilled North Carolina Car Crash Lawyers Who Care</h3>\n<p>When you have been hurt in a car accident of any kind, you need more than just a lawyer. You need an advocate who is understanding, compassionate, and able to get results. When you work with our firm, this begins immediately. We have more than 35 years of combined legal experience, and we know what it takes to get results, even in the most challenging car crash cases.  </p>\n<p>Our lawyers will conduct a thorough investigation into the circumstances of your accident, and we will identify every party that might potentially share in the liability for your injuries. Along the way, we will also listen carefully to you so that we can develop a full understanding of your injuries and how they are affecting your life. Our thorough, compassionate approach to personal injury cases has helped us obtain many favorable results for our clients, and we are ready to put our experience to work for you. </p>\n<p>At our law firm, we have helped hundreds of victims who have suffered injuries in many different types of motor vehicle accidents. Our skilled attorneys have recovered millions of dollars in verdicts and settlements for those who have been hurt in:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../../../truck-accidents.html\">Large truck accidents</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../../motorcycle-accidents.html\">Motorcycle crashes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../../drunk-driver-liability.html\">Drunk driving accidents</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../../emergency-vehicle-accidents.html\">Emergency vehicle accidents</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../../mass-transit-public-transportation-bus-train-accidents.html\">Mass transit accidents</a></li>\n<li>Pedestrian and <a href=\"../../../bicycle-bike-accidents.html\">bicycle accidents</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../../uninsured-underinsured-drivers-motorists-accidents.html\">Uninsured and underinsured driver accidents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What to Do After a Car Crash</h3>\n<p>When you are involved in any type of traffic accident, you should contact one of our injury lawyers as soon as possible. There are, however, other steps that you should take in order to help your case. In the wake of a motor vehicle accident, you should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Call 911</strong><span> – The primary concern after a crash should be the safety of everyone involved. By contacting emergency services, you can get immediate medical attention for those who need it. Your call will also guarantee that an accident report will be filed, which is an essential element if a lawsuit becomes necessary.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Collect information</strong> – In most cases, your attorney will not be able to make it to the scene of the crash, so it is up to you to gather as much information as possible. Important information includes contact and insurance info for everyone involved, a list of damages and injuries, and photographs of the accident.</li>\n<li><strong>Never admit fault</strong> – No matter how the accident happened, do not apologize or accept any part of the blame at the scene. This includes your conversations with the police, bystanders, and other parties. Even a simple apology could potentially damage your claim for compensation.</li>\n<li><strong>Seek medical attention</strong> – After an accident, it is important to see a doctor, even if you do not think you are seriously hurt. Some injuries may not be apparent to you for a matter of hours or days. Adrenaline can also mask the existence or the severity of your injuries, so you should always get checked out by a medical professional.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Put Our Team on Your Side</h3>\n<p>At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we know that insurance companies can be notoriously difficult to work with following a car accident, especially without an attorney. However, we also know the tactics and strategies that insurers often use to minimize their payouts. We will not be fooled or bullied into accepting substandard settlement offers. Instead, we will fight on your behalf until you get the compensation you need to rebuild. </p>\n<p>If you have been injured in a car accident, <a href=\"../../../../contact.html\">contact us </a>to schedule a free, no-obligation consultation with one of our experienced personal injury lawyers.

In the wake of a motor vehicle accident, you should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Call 911</strong><span> – The primary concern after a crash should be the safety of everyone involved. By contacting emergency services, you can get immediate medical attention for those who need it. Your call will also guarantee that an accident report will be filed, which is an essential element if a lawsuit becomes necessary.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Collect information</strong> – In most cases, your attorney will not be able to make it to the scene of the crash, so it is up to you to gather as much information as possible. Important information includes contact and insurance info for everyone involved, a list of damages and injuries, and photographs of the accident.</li>\n<li><strong>Never admit fault</strong> – No matter how the accident happened, do not apologize or accept any part of the blame at the scene. This includes your conversations with the police, bystanders, and other parties. Even a simple apology could potentially damage your claim for compensation.</li>\n<li><strong>Seek medical attention</strong> – After an accident, it is important to see a doctor, even if you do not think you are seriously hurt. Some injuries may not be apparent to you for a matter of hours or days. Adrenaline can also mask the existence or the severity of your injuries, so you should always get checked out by a medical professional.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Put Our Team on Your Side</h3>\n<p>At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we know that insurance companies can be notoriously difficult to work with following a car accident, especially without an attorney. However, we also know the tactics and strategies that insurers often use to minimize their payouts. We will not be fooled or bullied into accepting substandard settlement offers. Instead, we will fight on your behalf until you get the compensation you need to rebuild. </p>\n<p>If you have been injured in a car accident, <a href=\"../../../../contact.html\">contact us </a>to schedule a free, no-obligation consultation with one of our experienced personal injury lawyers. Call <strong class=\"makeCall\">1-844-YO-PELEO</strong> or <strong class=\"makeCall\">919-989-3000</strong> for an appointment today.
