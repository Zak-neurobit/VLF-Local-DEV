We happen to agree with the many people seeking citizenship that our country is a pretty great place to live! However, when it comes to the legal processes behind immigration, it’s common for people to face a lot of red tape and barriers to entry. Legal procedures always seem complex, and trying to navigate them in a country or language that is foreign to you can seem like a nightmare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our </span><a href=\"../index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smithfield immigration lawyers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at Vasquez Law Firm have spent a combined 40 years helping good people make their homes in the United States of America. We want to help you create the life you have dreamed of! Reach out to schedule a free initial consultation and get started!</span></p>\n<h2><b>How Our Smithfield Immigration Lawyers Can Help You&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Smithfield immigration lawyers of Vasquez Law Firm are well versed in many practice areas related to immigration law. Some of the common immigration aspects we can help with include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html\"><b>Visas</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: For those who are looking to stay in the U.S., a visa is a necessity. There are different types of visas that function on temporary or permanent bases. Because there are so many visas out there, it can be confusing to choose the right one one and then follow the procedure for getting it. We can help you ensure that your application is the correct one!</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/green-card\"><b>Green cards</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Being granted a green card is often the first step toward naturalization, which is the goal of many people coming to the U.S.! A green card gives you permanent residency status in the U.S. and allows you to do things like work legally and help family members begin their process for immigration. In order to get a green card, you will need sponsorship from a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, so keep that in mind as you start the green card process.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"../north-carolina-attorney/if-i-am-convicted-of-a-crime-will-i-get-deported.html\"><b>Deportation appeals</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There are many reasons removal proceedings might begin against a visa or green card holder. Your residency permissions might be expiring or you could be under threat of deportation thanks to criminal activity. If you are being subject to removal proceedings, we can help you potentially appeal the decision or take other measures such as adjusting your status. If you want to leave voluntarily to return at a later date, we can help you with the details.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"../north-carolina-attorney/what-are-the-requirements-for-adjustment-of-status-for-immigrants.html\"><b>Adjustment of status</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Ready to make the jump from visa to green card? We can help you begin the process.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/DACA\"><b>DACA</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Act gives documentation and legal status to people who have been in the U.S. since childhood. </span><a href=\"../north-carolina-attorney/can-immigrants-still-qualify-for-the-daca-program-in-2021-and-beyond.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DACA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gives “Dreamers” the right to work in the U.S. and provides them with necessities like a social security number and I.D. It also protects them from removal proceedings. If you meet the eligibility requirements, you can be covered by DACA.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Criminal offenses</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you are convicted of a crime, you can have your visa or green card revoked and potentially be subject to removal proceedings. As “crimmigration” lawyers, we know how to defend your residency here in the U.S. and potentially shield you from legal penalties associated with crimes such as </span><a href=\"../north-carolina-attorney/how-can-drug-charges-impact-immigration-status.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drug charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, DWI, and theft.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Naturalization</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you are ready to become a citizen of the U.S., we can walk you through the process of naturalization, including your application, citizenship tests, and interviews. Ultimately, we want to help you achieve your American dream!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Vasquez Law Firm Can Help You Achieve Your American Dream</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With over 40 years of experience helping our clients overcome struggles related to immigration, there are few problems we don’t know how to take on.

We happen to agree with the many people seeking citizenship that our country is a pretty great place to live! However, when it comes to the legal processes behind immigration, it’s common for people to face a lot of red tape and barriers to entry. Legal procedures always seem complex, and trying to navigate them in a country or language that is foreign to you can seem like a nightmare.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our </span><a href=\"../index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smithfield immigration lawyers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at Vasquez Law Firm have spent a combined 40 years helping good people make their homes in the United States of America. We want to help you create the life you have dreamed of! Reach out to schedule a free initial consultation and get started!</span></p>\n<h2><b>How Our Smithfield Immigration Lawyers Can Help You&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Smithfield immigration lawyers of Vasquez Law Firm are well versed in many practice areas related to immigration law. Some of the common immigration aspects we can help with include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html\"><b>Visas</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: For those who are looking to stay in the U.S., a visa is a necessity. There are different types of visas that function on temporary or permanent bases. Because there are so many visas out there, it can be confusing to choose the right one one and then follow the procedure for getting it. We can help you ensure that your application is the correct one!</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/green-card\"><b>Green cards</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Being granted a green card is often the first step toward naturalization, which is the goal of many people coming to the U.S.! A green card gives you permanent residency status in the U.S. and allows you to do things like work legally and help family members begin their process for immigration. In order to get a green card, you will need sponsorship from a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, so keep that in mind as you start the green card process.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"../north-carolina-attorney/if-i-am-convicted-of-a-crime-will-i-get-deported.html\"><b>Deportation appeals</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There are many reasons removal proceedings might begin against a visa or green card holder. Your residency permissions might be expiring or you could be under threat of deportation thanks to criminal activity. If you are being subject to removal proceedings, we can help you potentially appeal the decision or take other measures such as adjusting your status. If you want to leave voluntarily to return at a later date, we can help you with the details.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"../north-carolina-attorney/what-are-the-requirements-for-adjustment-of-status-for-immigrants.html\"><b>Adjustment of status</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Ready to make the jump from visa to green card? We can help you begin the process.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/DACA\"><b>DACA</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Act gives documentation and legal status to people who have been in the U.S. since childhood. </span><a href=\"../north-carolina-attorney/can-immigrants-still-qualify-for-the-daca-program-in-2021-and-beyond.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DACA</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gives “Dreamers” the right to work in the U.S. and provides them with necessities like a social security number and I.D. It also protects them from removal proceedings. If you meet the eligibility requirements, you can be covered by DACA.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Criminal offenses</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you are convicted of a crime, you can have your visa or green card revoked and potentially be subject to removal proceedings. As “crimmigration” lawyers, we know how to defend your residency here in the U.S. and potentially shield you from legal penalties associated with crimes such as </span><a href=\"../north-carolina-attorney/how-can-drug-charges-impact-immigration-status.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">drug charges</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, DWI, and theft.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Naturalization</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you are ready to become a citizen of the U.S., we can walk you through the process of naturalization, including your application, citizenship tests, and interviews. Ultimately, we want to help you achieve your American dream!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Vasquez Law Firm Can Help You Achieve Your American Dream</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With over 40 years of experience helping our clients overcome struggles related to immigration, there are few problems we don’t know how to take on.
