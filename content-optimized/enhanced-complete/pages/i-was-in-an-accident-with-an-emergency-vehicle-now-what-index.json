Negligent driving, even if responding to an emergency, can result in liability for damages and injuries.</p>\n<h2>Responsibilities of a Private Motorist</h2>\n<p>As a private motorist, you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yield to the right-of-way of emergency vehicles displaying flashing lights and sounding sirens.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ncdps.gov/our-organization/law-enforcement/state-highway-patrol/laws/move-over-law#:~:text=The%20law%20requires%20motorists%20slow,and%20can%20do%20so%20safely.\">Move</a>&nbsp;to the side of the road and come to a complete stop, allowing the emergency vehicle to pass.</li>\n<li>Avoid obstructing emergency vehicles and provide them with a clear path.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contact Our Johnston County, NC Emergency Vehicle Accident Injury Attorney</h2>\n<p>In North Carolina, understanding the laws regarding emergency vehicles can help you navigate these situations more confidently.
