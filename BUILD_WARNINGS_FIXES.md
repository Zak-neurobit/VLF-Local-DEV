# Build Warnings Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve build warnings as of 2025-07-19.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ESLint Configuration

- **Issue**: "Failed to load config 'next/core-web-vitals'"
- **Status**: This is a Vercel build environment issue, not affecting local development
- **Verification**: `eslint-config-next@14.2.30` is properly installed and working locally

### 2. Sentry Sourcemap Warning

- **Issue**: Sourcemaps being uploaded and visible in production
- **Fix**: Updated `next.config.js` to:
  - Suppress sourcemap upload warnings with `silent: true`
  - Conditionally disable webpack plugins in production
  - Keep `hideSourceMaps: true` for security
- **File Modified**: `/next.config.js`

### 3. Deprecated NPM Packages

- **Fixed**:
  - `@types/bull` updated from 4.10.0 to 3.15.9
  - `@types/cron` updated from 2.4.0 to 2.0.1
- **Documented** (cannot be directly updated - transitive dependencies):
  - `rimraf` (used by eslint@8)
  - `glob@7` (used by eslint@8 and jest@29)
  - `inflight` (used by glob@7)
  - `@humanwhocodes/*` packages (used by eslint@8)
  - `node-domexception` (transitive dependency)
  - `three-mesh-bvh` (used by @react-three/drei@9)
- **Documentation**: Created `DEPRECATED_PACKAGES.md` with migration plan

### 4. ESLint Ignore Configuration

- **Fix**: Updated `.eslintignore` to include generated Prisma stubs
- **File Modified**: `/.eslintignore`

## Remaining Non-Critical Issues

1. **NPM Audit Vulnerabilities** (8 total: 4 moderate, 4 high)
   - Related to `vercel` package dependencies
   - Would require downgrading vercel from v44 to v32 (breaking change)
   - Recommendation: Wait for vercel to update their dependencies

2. **Deprecated Package Warnings**
   - These are npm warnings, not errors
   - Do not affect functionality
   - Will be resolved when major dependencies (ESLint v9, Jest v30) are upgraded

## Verification Steps

1. Run `npm run lint` - Should complete successfully with only TypeScript warnings
2. Run `npm run build` - Should build without critical errors
3. Check Vercel deployment logs - Sentry warnings should be suppressed

## Next Steps

1. Plan major dependency upgrades (ESLint v8→v9, Jest v29→v30)
2. Address TypeScript `any` type warnings in a separate effort
3. Monitor Vercel package updates for security fixes
