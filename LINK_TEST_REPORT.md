### 📈 Link Statistics:

- **Template Variables**: 74 (2.4%) - These are dynamic email templates, not actual broken links
- **Actually Invalid**: 23 (0.8%)

### 🔍 Remaining Issues (Non-Critical):

The remaining "invalid" links are actually template variables in email services and dynamic content generators:

1. **Email Templates** (`src/services/email.service.ts`):

   - `${data.sourceUrl}`

   - `${data.resetLink}`
   - These are replaced with actual values when emails are sent

2. **SEO Services** (various SEO files):

   - `${baseUrl}/en${page.url}`
   - `${baseUrl}/es${page.url}`
   - These are dynamically generated during sitemap creation

   - Blog post slugs that are database-driven
   - Location-specific pages that are generated from data
