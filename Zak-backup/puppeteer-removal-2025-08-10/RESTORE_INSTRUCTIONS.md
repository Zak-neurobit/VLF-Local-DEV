## Alternative Solutions

If you need the functionality that Puppeteer provided, consider these alternatives:

1. **For Web Scraping**:
   - Use official APIs (TikTok API, Instagram Graph API, etc.)
   - Consider Playwright as a Puppeteer alternative
   - Use server-side fetch with cheerio for simple HTML parsing

2. **For Performance Testing**:
   - Use Lighthouse CLI directly
   - Consider WebPageTest API
   - Use built-in browser DevTools

3. **For Browser Automation**:
   - Playwright (Microsoft's alternative to Puppeteer)
   - Selenium WebDriver
   - Cypress for testing
