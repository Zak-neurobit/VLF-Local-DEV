# Navigation Fix Test Instructions

## Changes Made
I've temporarily disabled three components that were potentially blocking navigation:
1. DOMSafeWrapper - was wrapping all content
2. DOMSafetyInitializer - was adding event listeners
3. ExternalScriptGuardian - was monitoring external scripts

## How to Test
1. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Try clicking on the navigation menu items:
   - Practice Areas dropdown
   - Attorneys dropdown  
   - About Us
   - Contact
   - Blog
   - William Vasquez's attorney page

## If Navigation Works ✅
The fix is successful! The safety components were blocking clicks.

## If Navigation Still Doesn't Work ❌
Run the restore script to revert all changes:
```
Zak-backup\navigation-fix-2025-08-11\restore.bat
```

Then restart the dev server and we'll try a different approach.

## Files Modified
- src/app/layout.tsx (3 components commented out)

All original files are backed up in this folder.
