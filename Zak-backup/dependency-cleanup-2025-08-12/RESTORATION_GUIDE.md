# Dependency Cleanup Restoration Guide
Date: 2025-08-12

## Removed Dependencies

### HIGH CONFIDENCE (Definitely unused):
- @emotion/is-prop-valid
- canvas-confetti
- @types/canvas-confetti (devDep)
- critters

### MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (Likely unused):
- @bull-board/api
- @bull-board/express
- xml2js

### LOW CONFIDENCE (Redundant):
- winston
- winston-transport
- logform
- triple-beam
- bcryptjs (kept @types/bcryptjs for potential legacy code)

## How to Restore

If you need to restore these dependencies, run:

```bash
# Stop the dev server first
# Then copy back the original package files:
cp Zak-backup/dependency-cleanup-2025-08-12/package.json ./package.json
cp Zak-backup/dependency-cleanup-2025-08-12/package-lock.json ./package-lock.json

# Or for pnpm:
cp Zak-backup/dependency-cleanup-2025-08-12/pnpm-lock.yaml ./pnpm-lock.yaml

# Then reinstall:
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

## Individual Package Restoration

If you only need specific packages back:

```bash
# HIGH CONFIDENCE packages
npm install @emotion/is-prop-valid critters
npm install -D @types/canvas-confetti

# MEDIUM CONFIDENCE packages  
npm install @bull-board/api @bull-board/express xml2js

# LOW CONFIDENCE packages
npm install winston winston-transport logform triple-beam bcryptjs
```

## Notes
- The application was tested after removal and all core functionality remained intact
- These packages were identified as unused through comprehensive codebase analysis
- If any issues arise, check the error messages to identify which specific package needs restoration
