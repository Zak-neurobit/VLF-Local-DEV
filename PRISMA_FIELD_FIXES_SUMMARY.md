# Prisma Field Access Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. **billing-payments.ts** - Major fixes

- **Enum Values**: Updated all enum values to match Prisma schema (uppercase)

  - `InvoiceStatus`: Changed to `DRAFT`, `SENT`, `PAID`, `PARTIALLY_PAID`, `OVERDUE`, `CANCELLED`
  - `PaymentStatus`: Changed to `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`, `REFUNDED`, `PARTIALLY_REFUNDED`
  - `PaymentMethod`: Changed to `CARD`, `ACH`, `CHECK`, `WIRE`, `CASH`

- **Invoice Model Fields**: Fixed field names to match Prisma schema

  - `totalAmount` → `total`
  - `paidAmount` → `amountPaid`
  - `balanceDue` → `amountDue`
  - `taxAmount` → `tax`
  - `paidDate` → `paidAt`
  - `billingPeriod`, `sentDate`, `issuedDate` → moved to `metadata` object
  - Removed non-existent fields and stored them in `metadata` JSON field

- **Payment Model Fields**: Fixed field names to match Prisma schema

  - Added required fields: `clientEmail`, `clientName`, `gateway`
  - `stripePaymentIntentId` → `gatewayChargeId`
  - `transactionId` → `gatewayTransactionId`
  - `processedDate` → `processedAt`
  - Removed `clientId` (doesn't exist in schema)
  - Moved extra fields to `metadata` object

- **PaymentPlan Model Fields**: Fixed field names to match Prisma schema
  - `clientId` → removed, added `clientEmail` and `clientName`
  - `numberOfPayments` → `installments`
  - `monthlyPayment` → `monthlyAmount`
  - `remainingBalance` → `remainingAmount`
  - `downPayment` → `paidAmount`
  - `paymentSchedule` → moved to `metadata` object

### 2. **Function Signatures Updated**

- Added missing parameters to functions:
  - `createInvoice`: Added `clientEmail`, `clientName`
  - `processPayment`: Added `clientEmail`, `clientName`, `clientPhone`
  - `createPaymentPlan`: Added `clientEmail`, `clientName`
  - `getClientBillingSummary`: Added `clientEmail` parameter
  - `generateFinancialReport`: Added `clientEmail` parameter

### 3. **Query Filters Updated**

- Changed `clientId` filters to `clientEmail` in payment queries
- Updated field references in aggregation functions

### 4. **Type Casting**

- Added proper type casting for `metadata` field access
- Used `as any` for JSON field parsing where necessary

## Implementation Notes

1. The Prisma schema uses UPPER_CASE for enum values while the code was using lowercase
2. Many fields that existed in the local interfaces don't exist in the actual Prisma schema
3. The `metadata` JSON field is used to store additional data that doesn't have dedicated columns
4. Payment model doesn't have a `clientId` field - it uses `clientEmail`, `clientName`, and `clientPhone`
5. Several computed fields (like `balanceDue`) were being treated as database fields when they should be calculated

## Remaining Work

Other models still need stub implementations:

- `clientAssessment`
- `clientContactRequest`
- `client` (different from `User`)
- `followUpAction`
- `auditLog`

These can be added to the `prisma-model-stubs.ts` file following the same pattern as the existing stubs.
