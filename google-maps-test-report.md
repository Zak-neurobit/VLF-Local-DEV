## Conclusion

The Google Maps functionality across the VLF Website is largely working correctly. The major issue with the Charlotte office page has been resolved, and all individual office maps are functioning properly with good error handling and accessibility features.

The minor issue with the homepage MiniMap requires additional investigation but does not affect the core functionality of providing location information to users.

**Recommended Next Steps:**

1. Debug homepage OfficeLocations component rendering
2. Perform manual testing on various devices and browsers
3. Set up monitoring for map load failures
4. Consider performance optimizations for production deployment

**Test Status:** PASS with minor issues ✅
