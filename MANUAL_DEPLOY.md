# Manual Deployment Steps for Vercel

Since the automatic deployment isn't triggering, follow these steps:

## Option 1: Trigger from Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard**: https://vercel.com/hodos-360/vlf-website
   
2. **Check Git Integration**:
   - Click "Settings" → "Git"
   - Make sure it's connected to `quez2777/VLF-Website`
   - If not connected, click "Connect Git Repository"

3. **Manual Redeploy**:
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Find the last deployment (even if failed)
   - Click the three dots menu → "Redeploy"
   - Or click "Create Deployment" button

## Option 2: Create Fresh Project

Since you have two projects (vlf-website and vlf-website-new), you might want to use the new one:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/new/hodos-360
2. Click "Import Git Repository"
3. Select `quez2777/VLF-Website`
4. Name it `vlf-website-production` (or keep existing)
5. **IMPORTANT**: Add environment variables before deploying:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_eCqcU6ELgvJ5@ep-old-mode-a4bj2csn-pooler.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=QnJ386rd1BIjDuiik6ccHXD3OVtNxMBo/3F+IOJLu+M=
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://[your-project-name].vercel.app
   MOCK_REDIS=true
   MOCK_EMAIL=true
   MOCK_SMS=true
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

## Option 3: Force Push to Trigger Build

1. Make a small change:
   ```bash
   cd "/Users/williamvasquez/Documents/VLF Website"
   echo "# Deploy trigger $(date)" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Trigger Vercel deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Check These URLs:

- Project 1: https://vlf-website-hodos-360.vercel.app
- Project 2: https://vlf-website-new-hodos-360.vercel.app
- Dashboard: https://vercel.com/hodos-360

## Why the build might not show:

1. **Git integration disconnected** - Most common issue
2. **Wrong branch** - Make sure it's watching 'main' branch
3. **Build disabled** - Check Settings → Git → Production Branch
4. **Team permissions** - Make sure you have access to hodos-360 team

The code is ready and will build successfully once deployed!
