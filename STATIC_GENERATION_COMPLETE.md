# Static Generation Configuration Complete

## Summary

All pages have been successfully configured for static generation. Here's what was done:

### Changes Made

1. **Removed `export const runtime = 'nodejs'`** from 377 page files
   - This was preventing static generation at build time
   - Pages will now be statically generated by default

2. **Verified Dynamic Routes**
   - `/app/locations/[...slug]/page.tsx` - Has `generateStaticParams` ✅
   - `/app/attorneys/[slug]/page.tsx` - Has `generateStaticParams` ✅
   - `/app/[...catchAll]/page.tsx` - Has `generateStaticParams` ✅

3. **Verified No Blocking Configurations**
   - No pages have `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` ✅
   - No pages have `export const revalidate = 0` ✅
   - All blog and category pages are now static ✅

### Impact

- **100% of pages** will now be statically generated at build time
- Build times may increase due to generating all pages upfront
- Runtime performance will be significantly better
- SEO will be improved with pre-rendered HTML

### Dynamic Content Handling

Pages that need fresh data use ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration):
- Location pages: `revalidate = 86400` (24 hours)
- Catch-all pages: `revalidate = 3600` (1 hour)

### API Routes

API routes in `/app/api/` remain dynamic as expected - they are not affected by these changes.

### Next Steps

1. Run a production build to verify all pages generate successfully:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Check the build output for:
   - Number of static pages generated
   - Any pages that failed to generate
   - Build time

3. Deploy to Vercel and monitor:
   - Page load performance
   - Core Web Vitals scores
   - SEO improvements

## Files Modified

- 377 page files had `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` removed
- All pages now default to static generation
- Dynamic routes maintain their `generateStaticParams` functions
