2. **Contact Created** in GHL with tags:

   - `website-lead`
   - `practice-area-[type]`

â†’ Triggers: Immigration Spanish Campaign + Urgent Response
â†’ SMS to lead (Spanish) + SMS to attorney + Create opportunity
```

```

## Monitoring & Analytics:

### In GHL Dashboard:

### Website Analytics API:

```

Authorization: Bearer [your-token]
```

## Troubleshooting:

### "Lead not appearing in GHL"

- Check API key is correct
- Verify Location ID matches
- Look for errors in Vercel logs

### "Campaign not triggering"

- Verify campaign ID in env vars
- Check campaign is active in GHL
- Ensure tags match trigger conditions

### "SMS not sending"

- Check GHL phone number is configured
- Verify SMS credits available
- Test number not on DNC list

## Best Practices:

1. **Response Time**: Set campaigns to respond within 5 minutes
2. **Language Match**: Always use same language as lead
3. **Follow-up**: 3-touch minimum (immediate, 1hr, 1 day)
4. **Tracking**: Use UTM parameters for source tracking
5. **Testing**: Test each form monthly

## Cost Optimization:

- SMS: $0.015 per segment (160 chars)
- Email: Included in GHL plan
- Phone: Use Twilio for better rates
- Campaigns: Batch similar leads
