## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Agents Stop Working:
```bash

curl http://localhost:3000/api/crews/status

# Check health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/crews/health

# Restart all agents
npm run crews:launch
```

### If Memory Usage High:
The system automatically manages memory, but you can force cleanup:
```bash
# Check logs for memory warnings
curl http://localhost:3000/api/crews/logs?timeRange=1h

# System will auto-optimize, or restart if needed
npm run crews:launch
```

### If Tasks Stop Processing:
```bash
# Check task queue
curl http://localhost:3000/api/crews/metrics

# View recent activity
curl http://localhost:3000/api/crews/logs?limit=20
```

## 📝 Log Files

All activity is logged to:
- Console output (real-time)
- Database (persistent)
- API endpoints (queryable)

View logs in real-time:
```bash
# If running in background
tail -f logs/crews.log

# Via API
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/crews/logs?limit=50&timeRange=1h"
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

The system is working when you see:
- ✅ "AUTONOMOUS SYSTEM OPERATIONAL" message
- ✅ Regular task completion logs
- ✅ API endpoints responding
- ✅ Increasing task counts in metrics
- ✅ Content being generated
- ✅ Reviews being monitored
- ✅ Competitor analysis running

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables:
```bash
# Optional performance tuning
export CREW_MAX_WORKERS=10
export CREW_TASK_TIMEOUT=30000
export CREW_MEMORY_LIMIT=512MB
export CREW_LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Custom Schedules:
Edit `scripts/crewai-startup-system.ts` to modify:
- Task frequencies
- Agent behaviors
- Monitoring intervals
- Auto-recovery settings

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with Demo**: Always run `npm run crews:demo` first to see immediate results
2. **Monitor Health**: Check the health endpoint regularly
3. **Review Logs**: Use the logs API to understand agent behavior
4. **Scale Gradually**: Increase task frequency as system proves stable
5. **Background Mode**: Use background launch for production

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once the system is running:
1. Monitor the dashboards for 10-15 minutes
2. Check generated content quality
3. Verify social media posting
4. Confirm review monitoring
5. Adjust frequencies if needed
6. Scale up successful agents
7. Let it run autonomously!
