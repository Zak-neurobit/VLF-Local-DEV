## 2025-08-11: Fixed Audio Visualization for User Speech

### What Was Fixed
1. **RetellVoiceChat.tsx**:
   - Changed audio analysis from frequency domain to time domain data
   - Switched from `getByteFrequencyData` to `getByteTimeDomainData`
   - Implemented RMS (Root Mean Square) calculation for better voice detection
   - Increased sensitivity by 4x for microphone input

2. **VoiceCallModal.tsx**:
   - Lowered detection threshold from 0 to 0.01
   - Added wave effect animation to soundbars
   - Increased update rate from 100ms to 50ms for smoother animation
   - Enhanced visual feedback with minimum bar height

### Why It Was Fixed
- Soundbars weren't animating when users spoke into the microphone
- Only worked when AI assistant spoke
- Frequency domain analysis wasn't sensitive enough for speech

### Technical Details
- **Time Domain vs Frequency Domain**: Time domain data shows raw waveform (better for speech)
- **RMS Calculation**: More accurate for detecting voice levels than simple averaging
- **Sensitivity Multiplier**: 4x multiplier makes microphone input more visible

### Impact
- Soundbars now animate for both user speech and AI responses
- More responsive visual feedback during calls
- Better user experience with clear audio activity indication
