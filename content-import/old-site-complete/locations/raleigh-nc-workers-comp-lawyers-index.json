If you were injured at work, and if your injury has prevented you from working or has caused or exacerbated your depression or anxiety, you could be entitled to compensation.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"../index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Raleigh workers’ comp lawyers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at Vasquez Law Firm are experienced with helping clients who have been injured on the job seek the amount of damages that they deserve. Reach out to schedule a free consultation online and learn how we can help you settle your worker’s comp claim.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Types Of Workplace Injuries</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workplace injuries are generally thought of as occurring at construction sites or in other types of physically demanding jobs, but the truth is that they can happen to anyone in any type of workplace. Our Raleigh workers’ comp lawyers have represented clients with injuries that were sustained in all kinds of spaces, including offices. Some of the types of workers’ comp injuries we represent at Vasquez Law Firm include, but are not limited to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Overexertion and heavy lifting:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Injuries related to overexertion and heavy lifting account for most of the workplace injuries suffered by Americans, according to OSHA. Most of these injuries occur as a result of unsafe practices such as attempting to lift too much weight at once, lifting from an awkward position, and repetitive motions of lifting or carrying.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Repetitive motion:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When workers are required to perform repetitive tasks no matter how small, the repetition can cause strain that over time leads to injuries. Some common conditions that can result from repetitive motion tasks are carpal tunnel syndrome, knee injuries, shoulder and rotator cuff injuries, tendonitis, herniated discs, stress fractures, and more.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Equipment:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When heavy equipment is involved, operators are at risk of injury or even fatality. Industrial laborers are exposed to risks from equipment that can malfunction, toxic chemicals, electric shock, and machinery that has been worn down over time.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Construction site:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Construction sites are by their nature dangerous, and there are countless ways that injuries can occur on these sites. Everything from electrical shock and explosion to faulty equipment and vehicle accidents could be a reason someone is injured on a construction site.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Mental health:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Not many people think of depression and anxiety as a workers’ comp issue, but when you are injured on the job and you suffer a blow to your mental health because of anxiety surrounding the job that injured you or depression due to your injuries, workers’ compensation can also be used to pay for your mental healthcare.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are a few of the more common workplace injury possibilities, but they are not the only injuries that occur in the workplace. If you have sustained an injury on the job, we want to hear from you.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Why Do I Need A Workers’ Comp Lawyer If I’ve Been Injured?&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though you may be entitled to compensation, working with insurance can be tricky. Insurance companies are worried about their bottom line at the end of the day, and employers can be reluctant to cooperate. Even if you are offered some compensation for your injury, it might not be enough to cover your medical bills and the wages that you lost when you were not able to go to work. At Vasquez Law Group, we believe in fighting for what you are owed until it is paid to you in full.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Trust Our Raleigh Workers’ Comp Lawyers To Seek Justice For You</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With over 35 years of combined experience, Vasquez Law Group knows what it means to fight for workers’ comp.
