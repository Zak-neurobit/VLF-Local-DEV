For example, if you experience a collision with a commercial vehicle, you will have to deal with the insurance policies of that company, as well as their interest in protecting their driver from legal ramifications.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our Orlando auto accident lawyers can help you with several different types of </span><a href=\"https://www.flhsmv.gov/insurance/involved-in-a-crash/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vehicle accidents</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, including:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Truck accidents (including semis, tractor trailers, and other commercial vehicles)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"../types-of-damages-in-a-motorcycle-accident-injury-claim/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motorcycle accidents</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drunk driving accidents</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pedestrian accidents</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bicycle accidents</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hit and runs</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accidents caused by uninsured drivers</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accidents involving </span><a href=\"../i-was-in-an-accident-with-an-emergency-vehicle-now-what/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">emergency vehicles</span></a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accidents involving public or mass transportation&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And others!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have experienced one of these types of accidents, we can work with you to assess and pursue the compensation you are owed. Remember, no two accidents are the same, which is why we work with you to build a case using </span><a href=\"../types-of-evidence-in-your-auto-accident-injury-claim/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">evidence</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the accident, including the police report, photographs, and witness statements.</span></p>\n<p><strong>We Can Help You Seek Compensation</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are in a car accident, the </span><a href=\"../common-legal-mistakes-to-avoid-after-a-car-accident/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first rule</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you need to know is to never admit fault. If you admit fault, you can essentially say goodbye to any money you might have otherwise been owed. Always consult with legal counsel before telling your side of the story! You are likely in shock following an accident, and you do not have all of the information, so it’s best to say less until the lawyers of Vasquez Law Firm can help you assess the damages, gather evidence, communicate with insurance companies, and tailor a legal strategy that fits your needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know what you need in order to heal correctly and move on with the next stage of your life.
