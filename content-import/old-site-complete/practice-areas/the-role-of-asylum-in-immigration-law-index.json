In order to seek protection in the U.S., the person seeking asylum (the asylee) must have a reasonable belief that their safety is in danger should they stay in their home country.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-and-asylum/asylum\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeking asylum status</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gives the asylee recourse for legally establishing themselves in the U.S, as well as for other benefits that include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safety from deportation and persecution</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work authorization&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opportunity to apply for a green card</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opportunity to bring family to the U.S.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opportunity to apply for a social security card and other documentation</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opportunities to apply for healthcare</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ability for overseas travel</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes the word “refugee” is used interchangeably for people who are seeking asylum, but the key difference is that refugees have not yet entered the U.S. whereas asylees are already here and applying for the protections that asylum status affords. Otherwise, asylum seekers meet the same standard of definition as refugees.</span></p>\n<p><b>Who Can And Cannot File For Asylum?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to be granted asylum status, applicants must meet certain eligibility requirements. You could be eligible to seek asylum if you:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have come to the U.S. for protection from persecution</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are inside the United States or at a port of entry</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have been in the U.S. for less than a year, except in specific circumstances</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have not been previously denied for asylum</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have not passed through a safe third country, such as Canada</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not pose a danger to citizens of the U.S.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have not committed a serious crime (not all crimes will bar you from asylum)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you meet this criteria, you have the opportunity to apply for asylum. If you have been in the U.S. for more than a year, you cannot apply for asylum, except in certain cases such as if you did not initially fear to return to your home country but do now because of new social or political activity, had an acute medical emergency, was a victim of human trafficking, and other circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Process For Asylum</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two methods with which asylum seekers can apply:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Affirmative asylum</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Affirmative asylum is for people who are seeking asylum who are not currently going through removal proceedings. (You also cannot apply for affirmative asylum if you are an unaccompanied child in removal proceedings or have already submitted an application that is currently pending.) If the application is denied and you do not have legal status in the U.S., removal proceedings will begin against you.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Defensive asylum</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This type of filing is for people who are currently going through removal proceedings in the U.S. If you have previously been denied affirmative asylum, you can reapply for defensive asylum.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within a year of your arrival to the U.S., you can begin the process of applying for asylum by filing </span><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/i-589\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form I-589</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There is no fee to apply. You will need to prove that you meet the standards for asylum, which includes an asylum interview for which you can secure legal counsel to accompany you. After this interview, the decision might take as long as two weeks, or you will get your results by mail.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, your journey to secure asylum in the U.S. can take years to complete. After you have been granted asylum, you will be immediately authorized to work in the U.S. In addition, you can apply for a green card after one year using </span><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/i-485\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form I-485</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Families Of Asylum Seekers</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have secured asylum in the U.S., you can go through the process to bring your family to the U.S using </span><a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/i-730\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form I-730</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This process does not include a fee. If you are attempting to bring your children over to the U.S., they must be under 21 and unmarried to qualify. Your deadline for petitioning on behalf of your family is two years after you have been granted asylum except in exceptional circumstances.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Vasquez Law Firm Can Help You With Your Immigration Legal Matters</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you are seeking asylum, a green card or visa, an adjustment of status, full naturalization, or other matters pertaining to immigration, Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, has the experience to help you through the legal particulars of your journey to the U.S. We have a combined 40 years of legal experience, and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">we want to help you establish a new life on American soi</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">l.
