You may also have lost wages and many other expenses that often mount quickly in the weeks and months following a crash.

Our compassionate team is here to help you explore your options for collecting the compensation you need to get back on your feet.",
      "Auto insurance companies that serve the state of North Carolina are required to include uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage in the policies they sell to their clients. As the name implies, this type of coverage is designed to protect those involved in accidents caused by uninsured and underinsured drivers. An uninsured driver is any person who operates a motor vehicle without liability insurance that is required by law. An underinsured driver, by comparison, is a motorist who has auto insurance coverage that is compliant with the law, but the policy is not sufficient to cover the damages caused by the accident.",
      "According to estimates generated based on insurance claims, about 7 percent of North Carolina drivers do not have any insurance coverage. Underinsured drivers comprise a substantially larger portion of motorists in the state, but it is difficult to pinpoint a number because being “underinsured” depends on the amount of damages or losses sustained in a given accident. However, industry experts point out that state minimum coverages have not increased to keep pace with rising medical costs or the costs of car repairs. This means that there are tens of thousands of North Carolina drivers with minimum coverage who would be considered underinsured if they are ever at fault for a crash.",
      "Recovering compensation for a crash caused by an uninsured or underinsured driver is often possible but it is rarely easy. You are able to seek damages from the at-fault driver, but if he or she has failed to comply with the state’s insurance requirements, it may be difficult to collect everything you need to cover your losses. An uninsured or underinsured driver accident may leave you with no choice but to pursue compensation from your own insurance company.",
      "The team at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC has more than 35 years of personal injury experience. We know that insurance companies often look to minimize payouts and reduce their financial exposure, even to their own policyholders. Your carrier may offer a quick settlement that is far less than what you need or deserve for your injuries. Our experienced lawyers are not afraid to stand up to insurance companies, and we will continue to fight on your behalf until you get the compensation necessary in putting your life back together.",
      "We are honest, dependable, and skilled professionals who understand how to get the best possible results. Our team has obtained millions of dollars in settlements and verdicts for our clients, and we are ready to put our proven approach to work for you.",

    "If you have been injured in a car accident, you are probably wondering who will be responsible for paying your medical bills and the costs of getting your vehicle fixed. You may also have lost wages and many other expenses that often mount quickly in the weeks and months following a crash. As is the case in most states, North Carolina law requires drivers to maintain liability insurance for exactly such a scenario, but many drivers fail to carry the required coverage.",
    "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our experienced personal injury attorneys understand how frightening it can be to discover that the driver who caused your accident does not have sufficient insurance to cover your losses. We realize that you may feel stressed, anxious, and uncertain about how you will move forward, but the good news is that you are not alone. Our compassionate team is here to help you explore your options for collecting the compensation you need to get back on your feet.",
    "Auto insurance companies that serve the state of North Carolina are required to include uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage in the policies they sell to their clients. As the name implies, this type of coverage is designed to protect those involved in accidents caused by uninsured and underinsured drivers. An uninsured driver is any person who operates a motor vehicle without liability insurance that is required by law. An underinsured driver, by comparison, is a motorist who has auto insurance coverage that is compliant with the law, but the policy is not sufficient to cover the damages caused by the accident.",
    "According to estimates generated based on insurance claims, about 7 percent of North Carolina drivers do not have any insurance coverage. Underinsured drivers comprise a substantially larger portion of motorists in the state, but it is difficult to pinpoint a number because being “underinsured” depends on the amount of damages or losses sustained in a given accident. However, industry experts point out that state minimum coverages have not increased to keep pace with rising medical costs or the costs of car repairs. This means that there are tens of thousands of North Carolina drivers with minimum coverage who would be considered underinsured if they are ever at fault for a crash.",
    "Recovering compensation for a crash caused by an uninsured or underinsured driver is often possible but it is rarely easy. You are able to seek damages from the at-fault driver, but if he or she has failed to comply with the state’s insurance requirements, it may be difficult to collect everything you need to cover your losses. An uninsured or underinsured driver accident may leave you with no choice but to pursue compensation from your own insurance company.",
    "The team at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC has more than 35 years of personal injury experience. We know that insurance companies often look to minimize payouts and reduce their financial exposure, even to their own policyholders. Your carrier may offer a quick settlement that is far less than what you need or deserve for your injuries. Our experienced lawyers are not afraid to stand up to insurance companies, and we will continue to fight on your behalf until you get the compensation necessary in putting your life back together.",
    "We are honest, dependable, and skilled professionals who understand how to get the best possible results. Our team has obtained millions of dollars in settlements and verdicts for our clients, and we are ready to put our proven approach to work for you.",
    "For more information about how we can assist you in recovering compensation following an accident caused by an uninsured or underinsured driver, contact a member of our team. Call 1-844-YO-PELEO or 919-626-8450 for your no-cost consultation and case evaluation today. We represent injured victims in and around Wake County, Mecklenburg County, and Johnston County, North Carolina. Hablamos Español.",
