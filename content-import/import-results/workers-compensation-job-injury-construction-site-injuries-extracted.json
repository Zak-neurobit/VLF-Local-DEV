These benefits typically include reimbursement for necessary medical expenses, time away from work, and even temporary or permanent disability in serious cases.",
      "There are countless ways in which a worker can be injured on a construction site. Our lawyers are equipped to help you obtain work comp benefits for injuries caused by:",
      "You will not need to prove that anyone was at fault for your injuries to be eligible for workers’ compensation benefits. Under the law, you will only need to show that your injuries occurred in the course of performing your job as an employee. We will work closely with you in preparing and processing your claim so that you can get what you need to move forward with your life.",
      "The construction industry is different from most others in that a large number of those who work in construction-related fields are independent contractors. This means that workers’ compensation laws do not always apply when a construction worker is injured on the job. Additionally, injured workers who are eligible for workers’ compensation may quickly realize that the available benefits are not sufficient to cover all of their losses. These situations generally require the victim to file a third-party claim against any parties whose actions or negligence caused the victim’s injuries.",
      "The first step on the road to financial recovery after a construction site accident is determining exactly what happened and who may be responsible. Our lawyers will set up a time to meet with you and to get started in building your case. We will listen carefully to you so that we fully understand your situation and then go to work in conducting a comprehensive investigation into the accident. With more than 35 years of combined experience and a network of experts available to assist us along the way, we know what to look for and how to identify the liable party or parties.",
      "At our firm, we have the knowledge and tools to help you negotiate a favorable settlement whenever possible, but we also realize that settlement negotiations are not always successful. Insurance companies may stall, shift blame to you the victim, and engage in other tricks and techniques to avoid liability. Our team understands the games that insurance carriers often play, and we are prepared to take your case into the courtroom if necessary.",

  "paragraphs": [
    "A construction site, by its very nature, is an extremely dangerous place to work or even visit. Each year, tens of thousands of workers on injured on construction sites, and approximately 1,000 individuals are killed, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Construction site dangers are not limited to those who work in the construction industry, as visitors—both authorized and unauthorized—to such a site may also be at risk for injury as well. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our experienced workers’ compensation lawyers represent those who have been injured on construction sites as they seek compensation for their injuries.",
    "At our law firm, we understand that a construction site will always be dangerous, even under the best of circumstances. According to the North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act, if you are an employee who is injured in the course of doing your job, including on a construction site, you are generally eligible to receive workers’ compensation benefits for your injuries. These benefits typically include reimbursement for necessary medical expenses, time away from work, and even temporary or permanent disability in serious cases.",
    "There are countless ways in which a worker can be injured on a construction site. Our lawyers are equipped to help you obtain work comp benefits for injuries caused by:",
    "You will not need to prove that anyone was at fault for your injuries to be eligible for workers’ compensation benefits. Under the law, you will only need to show that your injuries occurred in the course of performing your job as an employee. We will work closely with you in preparing and processing your claim so that you can get what you need to move forward with your life.",
    "The construction industry is different from most others in that a large number of those who work in construction-related fields are independent contractors. This means that workers’ compensation laws do not always apply when a construction worker is injured on the job. Additionally, injured workers who are eligible for workers’ compensation may quickly realize that the available benefits are not sufficient to cover all of their losses. These situations generally require the victim to file a third-party claim against any parties whose actions or negligence caused the victim’s injuries.",
    "The first step on the road to financial recovery after a construction site accident is determining exactly what happened and who may be responsible. Our lawyers will set up a time to meet with you and to get started in building your case. We will listen carefully to you so that we fully understand your situation and then go to work in conducting a comprehensive investigation into the accident. With more than 35 years of combined experience and a network of experts available to assist us along the way, we know what to look for and how to identify the liable party or parties.",
    "At our firm, we have the knowledge and tools to help you negotiate a favorable settlement whenever possible, but we also realize that settlement negotiations are not always successful. Insurance companies may stall, shift blame to you the victim, and engage in other tricks and techniques to avoid liability. Our team understands the games that insurance carriers often play, and we are prepared to take your case into the courtroom if necessary.",
