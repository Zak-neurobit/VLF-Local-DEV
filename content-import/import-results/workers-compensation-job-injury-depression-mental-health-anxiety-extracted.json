We are ready to assist you in getting the compensation you need to get your life back on track.",
      "According to the North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act, an employee is usually eligible for work comp benefits for harm caused by an on-the-job accident or an occupational disease incurred in the course of the worker’s employment. When a work-related injury aggravates or accelerates a prior, non-disabling condition that was not work-related, the employee may receive benefits for the worsened condition. A physical example of this would be an employee who suffered a knee injury as a teenager, but the injury did not interfere with his ability to do his job. One day at work, the employee falls and aggravates the old injury to the point that he cannot work for a period of time. Such a situation would generally be compensable under North Carolina law.",
      "The same is true for mental health injuries and conditions such as depression and anxiety. Courts in North Carolina have maintained that when a workplace accident causes or exacerbates an employee’s mental health issues, the worker may be eligible for benefits to cover psychological and psychiatric treatment, as well as lost wages for time away from work. This means that if you were left unable to work due to a serious physical work-related injury, and your inability to provide for your family caused you to develop diagnosable depression, you could collect benefits for your mental health treatment as well.",
      "Benefits are also available for claims of mental health issues as occupational diseases. In order to be compensable, an occupational disease must be relatively typical for workers in a particular occupation or trade. If the general public is equally at risk for the condition as the employees are, the condition will not be considered an occupational disease. As applied to psychological issues, this means that the worker’s job must be a major factor in the development of the mental health condition. For example, suppose your job is particularly hazardous, and you regularly witness co-workers suffering severe physical injuries. In such a case, you could develop serious anxiety that inhibits your ability to perform your work-related duties. Because the occupational exposure caused your inability to work, work comp benefits would likely be available to you.",
      "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we understand that workers’ compensation claims based on mental health injuries can be challenging.

    "When a North Carolina employee is injured due to an accident in the workplace, state law provides that he or she is generally eligible to collect benefits under the state’s workers’ compensation program. Most people are aware that workers’ comp benefits are usually available for physical injuries sustained by employees on the job. However, it is not uncommon for injured employees to become severely depressed or anxious as a result of their job or the reality created by their physical injuries. It is also possible for mental health problems to develop because of the workplace conditions in certain industries and occupations.",
    "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our compassionate workers’ compensation attorneys understand the challenges you may be facing if you are suffering from depression or another mental health injury related to your job. We also know that proving that your mental health issues are work-related can be complicated. Our team has more than 35 years of combined workers’ comp experience, and we have helped many clients obtain benefits for work-related mental and emotional health issues. We are ready to assist you in getting the compensation you need to get your life back on track.",
    "According to the North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act, an employee is usually eligible for work comp benefits for harm caused by an on-the-job accident or an occupational disease incurred in the course of the worker’s employment. When a work-related injury aggravates or accelerates a prior, non-disabling condition that was not work-related, the employee may receive benefits for the worsened condition. A physical example of this would be an employee who suffered a knee injury as a teenager, but the injury did not interfere with his ability to do his job. One day at work, the employee falls and aggravates the old injury to the point that he cannot work for a period of time. Such a situation would generally be compensable under North Carolina law.",
    "The same is true for mental health injuries and conditions such as depression and anxiety. Courts in North Carolina have maintained that when a workplace accident causes or exacerbates an employee’s mental health issues, the worker may be eligible for benefits to cover psychological and psychiatric treatment, as well as lost wages for time away from work. This means that if you were left unable to work due to a serious physical work-related injury, and your inability to provide for your family caused you to develop diagnosable depression, you could collect benefits for your mental health treatment as well.",
    "Benefits are also available for claims of mental health issues as occupational diseases. In order to be compensable, an occupational disease must be relatively typical for workers in a particular occupation or trade. If the general public is equally at risk for the condition as the employees are, the condition will not be considered an occupational disease. As applied to psychological issues, this means that the worker’s job must be a major factor in the development of the mental health condition. For example, suppose your job is particularly hazardous, and you regularly witness co-workers suffering severe physical injuries. In such a case, you could develop serious anxiety that inhibits your ability to perform your work-related duties. Because the occupational exposure caused your inability to work, work comp benefits would likely be available to you.",
    "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we understand that workers’ compensation claims based on mental health injuries can be challenging. We also know that you do not need the added stress or aggravation that is often associated with the workers’ comp claims process. When you choose our firm to help with your case, we will advocate on your behalf every step of the way. Our lawyers will help you put together a case that is designed to get you the benefits you need as quickly as possible without compromising your rights.",
