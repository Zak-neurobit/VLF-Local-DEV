    "The global economic system continues to become more and more connected across international borders. With this in mind, it is hardly surprising that many American businesses and corporations have developed an increased interest in sponsoring foreign nationals to come to the United States to work.",
    "At Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our skilled immigration attorneys work closely with companies of all sizes and types to help obtain the appropriate visas for their non-citizen workers. The United States government offers a wide range of work- and employment-related visas, and we will assist you in determining the option that will best fit your business needs. We will also help you in preparing and submitting the necessary documentation for undocumented immigrants while complying with all applicable laws and regulations.",
    "Immigration laws in the United States offer temporary visas for foreign nationals to work in this country for a relatively short period of time. These visas are categorized as “non-immigrant” visas because, in general, they are not meant to be used as a means to obtain a Green Card or United States citizenship. Our team, following the immigration reform,  can help you work toward any kind of non-immigrant work visa, including but not limited to:",
    "Each year, the American government provides a specified number of employment-based immigration visas for first and second-generation immigrants that permit workers to enter, work, and remain in the United States permanently. This category of visas—called EB visas—is typically reserved for workers whose skills or work are identified as valuable to the U.S. economy. Generally, workers who come to the U.S. on EB visas do so with the intent of obtaining a Green Card and/or seeking United States citizenship.",
    "Immigrant work visas are processed using a preference system set by the federal government:",
    "If you run an American business or you represent an international company with a presence in the U.S., and you want to bring a foreign national to the United States so that he or she can work for you, there are likely to be many challenges ahead. The team at Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, will help you analyze your situation according to immigration law and work with you in determining the right option for you and your business. We will ensure that your best interests—as well as those of your intended employee—are fully protected throughout the entire visa application and entry process.",
