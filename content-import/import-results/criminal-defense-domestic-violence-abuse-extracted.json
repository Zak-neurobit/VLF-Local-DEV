      "Over the last few decades, North Carolina lawmakers have enacted a number of laws to combat the growing issue of domestic abuse. The state’s laws offer protection to a wide range of possible victims, including:",
      "According to North Carolina law, any act that intentionally causes or attempts to cause injury to such a victim is considered domestic violence. In addition, domestic violence also includes acts that place a victim in fear of “imminent serious bodily injury” due to threatened force.",
      "Depending on the circumstances, you could face a variety of charges under the state’s domestic violence laws, including simple assault, assault on a female, sexual assault, stalking, communicating threats, and any others. Such charges may be handled as misdemeanors that lead to probation or anger management programs, or they may be prosecuted as felonies punishable by significant time in state prison.",
      "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we realize that when the police respond to a domestic dispute call, they are often in a tough spot. The officers are forced to make quick decisions about which person or persons to arrest, if any. These decisions are often based on verbal allegations made in the heat of anger. However, if an officer has probable cause to believe that you committed a specific act of domestic violence or any felony, you will probably be arrested. You will almost certainly be arrested if you are in violation of a protective order filed against you. From there, it can be very difficult to stop the proceedings, even if the victim does not wish to press charges.",
      "It is important to contact an attorney at our firm as soon as you can after being arrested, and you should not answer any questions from the police or prosecutors until we arrive. From there, we will help you understand your available options, and we will work hard to ensure that your rights are fully protected along the way. We know that negotiating with prosecutors toward a plea deal may be in your best interest, but if you have been falsely accused, such a deal is not always a good idea. Pleading guilty to any type of domestic violence charge could affect not only your future but also your rights regarding your children. With this in mind, our lawyers are fully prepared to mount an aggressive, responsible defense on your behalf, and we will take your case all the way to trial if necessary to protect your innocence.",

    "Have you been accused of acts of domestic violence? Or, has a 50B protective order been filed against you? If so, you need legal help now. In the state of North Carolina, criminal charges related to domestic violence can be prosecuted as misdemeanors or felonies, depending on the circumstances. Either way, simply being accused of domestic abuse can change your life forever.",
    "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we know that many prosecutors and judges in North Carolina believe that family violence is a precursor to other crimes, such as assault, rape, and possibly murder. As a result, courts tend to take a hard line against allegations of domestic violence. If you are facing charges, our experienced criminal defense attorneys are equipped to help you protect your rights and your future.",
    "Over the last few decades, North Carolina lawmakers have enacted a number of laws to combat the growing issue of domestic abuse. The state’s laws offer protection to a wide range of possible victims, including:",
    "According to North Carolina law, any act that intentionally causes or attempts to cause injury to such a victim is considered domestic violence. In addition, domestic violence also includes acts that place a victim in fear of “imminent serious bodily injury” due to threatened force.",
    "Depending on the circumstances, you could face a variety of charges under the state’s domestic violence laws, including simple assault, assault on a female, sexual assault, stalking, communicating threats, and any others. Such charges may be handled as misdemeanors that lead to probation or anger management programs, or they may be prosecuted as felonies punishable by significant time in state prison.",
    "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we realize that when the police respond to a domestic dispute call, they are often in a tough spot. The officers are forced to make quick decisions about which person or persons to arrest, if any. These decisions are often based on verbal allegations made in the heat of anger. However, if an officer has probable cause to believe that you committed a specific act of domestic violence or any felony, you will probably be arrested. You will almost certainly be arrested if you are in violation of a protective order filed against you. From there, it can be very difficult to stop the proceedings, even if the victim does not wish to press charges.",
    "It is important to contact an attorney at our firm as soon as you can after being arrested, and you should not answer any questions from the police or prosecutors until we arrive. From there, we will help you understand your available options, and we will work hard to ensure that your rights are fully protected along the way. We know that negotiating with prosecutors toward a plea deal may be in your best interest, but if you have been falsely accused, such a deal is not always a good idea. Pleading guilty to any type of domestic violence charge could affect not only your future but also your rights regarding your children. With this in mind, our lawyers are fully prepared to mount an aggressive, responsible defense on your behalf, and we will take your case all the way to trial if necessary to protect your innocence.",
