      "Truck accidents are quite different from car accidents in several important ways. First, truck accident injuries are often more serious due to the size, weight, and momentum of big rigs. Trucks are also commonly owned and operated by multibillion-dollar transport companies who employ teams of attorneys to help them escape liability when accidents occur. Additionally, there are complicated laws and government regulations that regulate the trucking industry that can make handling a truck accident case on your own virtually impossible.",
      "When you work with our firm, your priorities become our priorities. Each case begins with a comprehensive investigation so that we can determine exactly what happened and what party or parties were at fault. It is not uncommon for truck accident liability to be shared by several parties, including the driver, the trucking company, and the truck manufacturer. If necessary, we will even enlist the help of outside experts to assist as we put together your case.",

We will communicate openly and honestly with you and help you make the best possible decisions regarding how to proceed. Our lawyers understand the challenges associated with navigating a truck accident injury case. We will not be intimidated by large trucking companies, their insurers, or their lawyers, and we will not be bullied into accepting a settlement that fails to meet your needs. Instead, we will continue to advocate on your behalf until you obtain maximum compensation for your injuries.",

    "They may be called big rigs, semis, 18-wheelers, or tractor-trailers, but regardless of what you know them as, large commercial trucks are extremely dangerous, especially when they are involved in accidents. Measuring about 70 feet long and weighing up to 80 tons or more, large trucks are huge, heavy vehicles that can cause devastating injuries to drivers and passengers in other cars on the road. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our Raleigh personal injury lawyers have the knowledge and experience to assist you when you have been injured in any type of accident involving a truck.",
    "North Carolina is home to a vast network of interstate highways, state highways, and local roads that includes thousands of miles of roadway. Due to the accessibility of Interstate 95, Interstate 40, and other major thoroughfares, thousands of trucks travel through the region each and every day. Unfortunately, the high volume of truck traffic means that crashes will happen, and when they do, it is usually the occupants of other vehicles that suffer the most. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we know the struggles that truck accident victims often face, and we are equipped to hold truck drivers and trucking companies responsible for the accidents they cause.",
    "With more than 35 years of personal injury experience, our attorneys are equipped to help you recover compensation for injuries you have sustained in any type of trucking accident, including crashes caused by:",
    "Truck accidents are quite different from car accidents in several important ways. First, truck accident injuries are often more serious due to the size, weight, and momentum of big rigs. Trucks are also commonly owned and operated by multibillion-dollar transport companies who employ teams of attorneys to help them escape liability when accidents occur. Additionally, there are complicated laws and government regulations that regulate the trucking industry that can make handling a truck accident case on your own virtually impossible.",
    "When you work with our firm, your priorities become our priorities. Each case begins with a comprehensive investigation so that we can determine exactly what happened and what party or parties were at fault. It is not uncommon for truck accident liability to be shared by several parties, including the driver, the trucking company, and the truck manufacturer. If necessary, we will even enlist the help of outside experts to assist as we put together your case.",
    "As our client, you will remain fully up to date with the progress of your case. We will communicate openly and honestly with you and help you make the best possible decisions regarding how to proceed. Our lawyers understand the challenges associated with navigating a truck accident injury case. We will not be intimidated by large trucking companies, their insurers, or their lawyers, and we will not be bullied into accepting a settlement that fails to meet your needs. Instead, we will continue to advocate on your behalf until you obtain maximum compensation for your injuries.",
    "If you have been injured in an accident involving a truck, contact the attorneys at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC for help. Call 1-844-YO-PELEO or 919-626-8450 to schedule a free, no-obligation consultation with a member of our team today.
