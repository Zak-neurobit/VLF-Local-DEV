  "ogDescription": "Workers’ Compensation Lawyers in Wake County for Equipment Caused Injuries According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 3 million non-fatal workplace injuries are reported by private employers in the United States every year. This number does not include those who are killed on the job, which often exceeds 5,000 workers annually. Research also shows that manufacturing and construction are two of the most dangerous industries in which a person can work, with injury rates among the highest for any occupation. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we understand that industrial accident victims often struggle to collect the compensation they need to put their lives back on track. If you have been injured while working with heavy or specialized equipment in a factory, manufacturing plant, or another industrial setting, you may be entitled to benefits under the North Carolina workers’ compensation system. Unfortunately, collecting such benefits is often challenging due to uncooperative employers and stubborn insurance carriers. The good news is that we can help.

      "Those who work in industrial environments face a variety of dangers on any given day. They are often surrounded by massive pieces of heavy equipment, electricity, toxic chemicals, and other hazardous conditions. While local, state, and federal regulations are intended to protect workers, equipment-related accidents and injuries still occur on an alarmingly regular basis. Tragically, many such accidents are preventable and have an identifiable cause.",
      "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our skilled attorneys recognize that a comprehensive investigation is often critical in securing full workers’ comp benefits for injured machine operators, welders, metalworkers, and other industrial laborers. Industrial accidents may be the result of:",
      "According to the North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act, workers’ compensation benefits are not supposed to depend on proving fault or direct liability for your equipment-related injuries. If your injuries occurred in the course of you doing your job, you are entitled to collect benefits for your medical expenses, lost wages, vocational retraining, and temporary or permanent disability. Sometimes, however, your employer or the workers’ compensation insurance carrier may dispute the extent of your injuries or attempt to claim that your injury was not related to your job. Our team will work hard to help you overcome any challenges that may arise so that you can obtain the full benefits available to you under the law.",
      "The attorneys at our firm have more than 35 years of combined legal experience. We realize that workers’ compensation is usually available in equipment accident cases, but it is not always sufficient to meet the victim’s needs. That is why we explore every possible avenue for recovering your losses, including third-party liability claims when appropriate. We are thorough, knowledgeable, and skilled professionals who have obtained millions of dollars in settlements and verdicts for our clients, and we will put our client-centered approach to work for you.",

    "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 3 million non-fatal workplace injuries are reported by private employers in the United States every year. This number does not include those who are killed on the job, which often exceeds 5,000 workers annually. Research also shows that manufacturing and construction are two of the most dangerous industries in which a person can work, with injury rates among the highest for any occupation.",
    "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we understand that industrial accident victims often struggle to collect the compensation they need to put their lives back on track. If you have been injured while working with heavy or specialized equipment in a factory, manufacturing plant, or another industrial setting, you may be entitled to benefits under the North Carolina workers’ compensation system. Unfortunately, collecting such benefits is often challenging due to uncooperative employers and stubborn insurance carriers. The good news is that we can help. Our accomplished workers’ compensation lawyers have secured favorable results for many clients who were injured at work, and we are ready to put our experience on your side.",
    "Those who work in industrial environments face a variety of dangers on any given day. They are often surrounded by massive pieces of heavy equipment, electricity, toxic chemicals, and other hazardous conditions. While local, state, and federal regulations are intended to protect workers, equipment-related accidents and injuries still occur on an alarmingly regular basis. Tragically, many such accidents are preventable and have an identifiable cause.",
    "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our skilled attorneys recognize that a comprehensive investigation is often critical in securing full workers’ comp benefits for injured machine operators, welders, metalworkers, and other industrial laborers. Industrial accidents may be the result of:",
    "According to the North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act, workers’ compensation benefits are not supposed to depend on proving fault or direct liability for your equipment-related injuries. If your injuries occurred in the course of you doing your job, you are entitled to collect benefits for your medical expenses, lost wages, vocational retraining, and temporary or permanent disability. Sometimes, however, your employer or the workers’ compensation insurance carrier may dispute the extent of your injuries or attempt to claim that your injury was not related to your job. Our team will work hard to help you overcome any challenges that may arise so that you can obtain the full benefits available to you under the law.",
    "The attorneys at our firm have more than 35 years of combined legal experience. We realize that workers’ compensation is usually available in equipment accident cases, but it is not always sufficient to meet the victim’s needs. That is why we explore every possible avenue for recovering your losses, including third-party liability claims when appropriate. We are thorough, knowledgeable, and skilled professionals who have obtained millions of dollars in settlements and verdicts for our clients, and we will put our client-centered approach to work for you.",
    "When you choose the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC to help with your equipment accident case, you become part of a team that is dedicated to protecting your best interests. We will work closely with you to fully understand all of the details of your case so that we can get you what you need to move forward. Our attorneys will communicate openly and honestly with you as your case progresses, and we will remain at your side every step of the way.",
