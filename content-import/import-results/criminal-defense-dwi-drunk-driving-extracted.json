      "The laws that address alcohol impairment are similar throughout the country, including here in North Carolina. A driver can be arrested and charged for DWI in North Carolina if the arresting officer observes behavior that is consistent with impairment. Such behavior may include erratic lane changes, inconsistent speed, and taking excessively wide turns. Other signs of impairment may be evident during a traffic stop, including slurred speech, confusion, alcohol on your breath, or trouble focusing.",
      "North Carolina law also includes statutory limits for blood alcohol content, or BAC. If a driver’s BAC exceeds these limits, he or she will likely be arrested and charged with DWI. The limit for an adult driver over the age of 21 is 0.08 percent, while the BAC limit for a commercial driver of legal drinking age in a commercial vehicle is 0.04 percent. For a driver who is under 21, any trace of alcohol consumption can lead to criminal charges.",
      "Under the law in North Carolina, a DWI offense is classified into one of five levels, ranging from level 5, the least serious, to level 1, which is the most serious. The offense level for your charge will depend on a number of factors, including your BAC level at the time of your arrest, your driving record, your prior DWI history, and other aggravating or mitigating factors.",
      "When you choose the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC to help with your DWI case, we will carefully review the circumstances of your case and help you understand the level of charges that you are facing. The penalties associated with a conviction will also depend on the level of the charge. A level 5 DWI, for example, is punishable by 24 hours to 60 days in jail and a fine of up to $200. A level 1 DWI conviction, by comparison, carries up to two years in jail and fines up to $4,000, with the other levels falling somewhere in between.",
      "A DWI conviction at any level will also result in a license suspension of six months to one year at the discretion of the court. Depending on your history, you could qualify for limited driving privileges during your suspension, and we can help you explore your available options. We can also help you get your license back at the conclusion of your suspension.",

    "Are you or a member of your family facing charges for driving while impaired (DWI) in North Carolina? If so, you are likely in for a long and difficult road ahead. A DWI conviction, even at the lowest level, can lead to severe criminal and administrative penalties, including jail time, expensive fines, and the loss of your driving privileges. In addition, insurance companies, prospective employers, and other parties could hold your conviction against you for many years to come.",
    "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we know that it might be tempting to try to handle a DWI charge on your own. However, proceeding without an attorney can be a big mistake. North Carolina’s DWI laws are complex, and a single error could have devastating consequences. The good news is that we can help. Our knowledgeable criminal defense lawyers provide honest, reliable, and affordable representation in all types of DWI cases. With more than 35 years of experience, we are equipped to help you obtain the best possible outcome for your unique circumstances.",
    "The laws that address alcohol impairment are similar throughout the country, including here in North Carolina. A driver can be arrested and charged for DWI in North Carolina if the arresting officer observes behavior that is consistent with impairment. Such behavior may include erratic lane changes, inconsistent speed, and taking excessively wide turns. Other signs of impairment may be evident during a traffic stop, including slurred speech, confusion, alcohol on your breath, or trouble focusing.",
    "North Carolina law also includes statutory limits for blood alcohol content, or BAC. If a driver’s BAC exceeds these limits, he or she will likely be arrested and charged with DWI. The limit for an adult driver over the age of 21 is 0.08 percent, while the BAC limit for a commercial driver of legal drinking age in a commercial vehicle is 0.04 percent. For a driver who is under 21, any trace of alcohol consumption can lead to criminal charges.",
    "Under the law in North Carolina, a DWI offense is classified into one of five levels, ranging from level 5, the least serious, to level 1, which is the most serious. The offense level for your charge will depend on a number of factors, including your BAC level at the time of your arrest, your driving record, your prior DWI history, and other aggravating or mitigating factors.",
    "When you choose the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC to help with your DWI case, we will carefully review the circumstances of your case and help you understand the level of charges that you are facing. The penalties associated with a conviction will also depend on the level of the charge. A level 5 DWI, for example, is punishable by 24 hours to 60 days in jail and a fine of up to $200. A level 1 DWI conviction, by comparison, carries up to two years in jail and fines up to $4,000, with the other levels falling somewhere in between.",
    "A DWI conviction at any level will also result in a license suspension of six months to one year at the discretion of the court. Depending on your history, you could qualify for limited driving privileges during your suspension, and we can help you explore your available options. We can also help you get your license back at the conclusion of your suspension.",
    "When you are facing DWI charges in North Carolina, you need an attorney who will ensure that your rights and best interests are fully protected.
