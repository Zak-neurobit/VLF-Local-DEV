When you stop and think about the effects that a conviction can have on a person’s life, the right to an attorney makes logical sense. Sadly, a much smaller number of people understand how helpful a qualified lawyer can be when you have been accused of a traffic offense as well. Because traffic violations are usually not classified as criminal offenses, the constitutional right to a court-appointed lawyer does not generally apply, but the reality is that an experienced traffic citations attorney can dramatically affect the outcome of your case.\nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our skilled lawyers have over 35 years of combined legal experience, and we understand the importance of protecting your rights when you have received a traffic ticket. We realize that you might be tempted to accept the consequences, pay the fine, and move on with your life, but doing so is not always your best option. Our team is equipped to help you analyze your situation and to provide the guidance you need in taking action to protect your best interests. \nJohnston County Counsel for Traffic Citations\nWhen you get a speeding ticket or any other citation for a traffic violation in North Carolina, signing the ticket and paying the associated fine are considered to be submitting a guilty plea to the court. In addition to the fine, fees, and court costs listed on your citation, you could also be subject to points on your driver’s license, increased car insurance premiums, and possibly the suspension of your driving privileges. In the most serious cases, you could even face time in jail. If your job requires you to drive, your livelihood could be in jeopardy as well. \nUnder the law in North Carolina, you have the right to contest any traffic citation, and you also have the right to hire an attorney to advocate on your behalf. If you contest the ticket, prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you committed the act in question to secure a conviction. When you choose our firm to help with your case, we will do everything we can to get the charges against you reduced or dismissed altogether. With this as our goal, we are prepared to:\n\nInvestigate the details of the alleged violation\nChallenge the basis for the citation and the evidence against you\nAdvocate for a reduction of the charge or a full dismissal, especially if your driving record is clean or there are issues with the state’s case\nUtilize our experience to negotiate a possible plea deal with prosecutors\nExplain to you the pros and cons of a plea deal and help you decide whether to take your case to trial\nExamine pre- and post-trial options to protect your driving privileges if a conviction is unavoidable\n\nTypes of Violations We Handle\nThe state of North Carolina takes traffic-related citations very seriously, and a conviction could have serious consequences. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our experienced lawyers have the knowledge and resources to help you contest citations for:\n\nSpeeding\nFailure to obey a traffic signal (running a red light or stop sign)\nImproper lane changes\nReckless driving\nDriving with a suspended or revoked license\nDriving while impaired (DWI)\nEquipment violations\nDriving without insurance or proper registration\nAll other moving violations and non-moving violations\n\nContact One of Our Skilled Attorneys Today\nBefore you decide to pay your traffic ticket, it is worth your time to speak with a traffic citation attorney at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC. Contact us to schedule your free consultation today. Call 1-844-YO-PELEO or 919-626-8450 for an appointment.

      "Most people are aware that if a person is arrested on the suspicion that he or she committed some type of crime, that individual is guaranteed the right to be represented by an attorney. When you stop and think about the effects that a conviction can have on a person’s life, the right to an attorney makes logical sense. Sadly, a much smaller number of people understand how helpful a qualified lawyer can be when you have been accused of a traffic offense as well. Because traffic violations are usually not classified as criminal offenses, the constitutional right to a court-appointed lawyer does not generally apply, but the reality is that an experienced traffic citations attorney can dramatically affect the outcome of your case.",
      "At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our skilled lawyers have over 35 years of combined legal experience, and we understand the importance of protecting your rights when you have received a traffic ticket.

Our team is equipped to help you analyze your situation and to provide the guidance you need in taking action to protect your best interests.",
      "When you get a speeding ticket or any other citation for a traffic violation in North Carolina, signing the ticket and paying the associated fine are considered to be submitting a guilty plea to the court. In addition to the fine, fees, and court costs listed on your citation, you could also be subject to points on your driver’s license, increased car insurance premiums, and possibly the suspension of your driving privileges. In the most serious cases, you could even face time in jail. If your job requires you to drive, your livelihood could be in jeopardy as well.",
      "Under the law in North Carolina, you have the right to contest any traffic citation, and you also have the right to hire an attorney to advocate on your behalf. If you contest the ticket, prosecutors must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you committed the act in question to secure a conviction. When you choose our firm to help with your case, we will do everything we can to get the charges against you reduced or dismissed altogether. With this as our goal, we are prepared to:",
      "The state of North Carolina takes traffic-related citations very seriously, and a conviction could have serious consequences. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our experienced lawyers have the knowledge and resources to help you contest citations for:",
