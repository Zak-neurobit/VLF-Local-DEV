In fact, freedom from oppression was one of the ideals on which our nation was founded. Those who face political, religious, personal, and other types of persecution in their home countries commonly seek a safe haven in America. With this in mind, American immigration laws allow such people to petition for asylum, which is often the first step toward lawful permanent residency and eventual citizenship.\nThe experienced immigration attorneys at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC fully understand the complexities that can arise in asylum-related cases. We also know what it takes to get favorable results. With more than 35 years of combined immigration law experience, our lawyers have the knowledge, resources, and tools to help you and your loved ones find the security you are looking for here in the United States.\nWhat Is Asylum?\nAccording to the immigration laws of the United States, an individual who has fled his or her home nation because of past persecution or a current fear of persecution can apply for a legal status known as “asylum.” In order to be eligible for asylum, the person must be fleeing persecution based on his or her race, religion, nationality, political beliefs, or social group. The person must also believe that returning to his or her country will be unsafe.\nIf the person is granted asylum by U.S. immigration officials, he or she officially becomes an “asylee.” Recognized asylees are able to petition for lawful permanent resident status—commonly known as a green card—after one year. Once an asylee has obtained a green card, there is a four-year waiting period before the individual can apply to become a U.S. citizen through naturalization.\nThe Difference Between Asylum Seekers and Refugees\nAccording to the immigration reform of the United States, an individual who has fled his or her home nation because of past persecution or a current fear of persecution can apply for a legal status known as “asylum.” In order to be eligible for asylum, the person must be fleeing persecution based on his or her race, religion, nationality, political beliefs, or social group. The person must also believe that returning to his or her country will be unsafe.\nIf the person is granted asylum by U.S. immigration officials, he or she officially becomes an “asylee.” Recognized asylees are able to petition for lawful permanent resident status—commonly known as a green card—after one year. Once an asylee who is either first generation immigrant or second generationhas obtained a green card, there is a four-year waiting period before the individual can apply to become a U.S. citizen through naturalization.\nCharlotte Lawyers Assisting Asylum Seekers\nIn the vast majority of cases, a person seeking asylum must apply for asylee status within one year of arriving in the U.S. Technically, exceptions may be granted, but they are extremely rare. If you or a loved one is seeking asylum, the team at Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC can assist you with your petition. In your filing, you must provide specific details about:\n\nThe type of persecution you would face upon returning home.\nYour reasons for fearing persecution.\nThe parties or entities responsible for the persecution. Common examples include government entities or the military.\nThe nature and extent of the harm you have suffered due to past persecution.\nThe nature and extent of the harm you expect if you return home.\n\nDepending on the circumstances of your case, your petition may require a hearing in immigration court. If this happens, the attorneys at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC are ready to help demonstrate the gravity of your situation to the judge. We know that careful preparation is the key to success in an immigration court case status, and our lawyers will do everything we can to help you and your family obtain asylum in the United States.\nWe Are Here to Help\nFor more information about petitions for asylum, or to get started on your case, contact a member of our team today.

      "For over 200 years, the United States has offered safety and security to oppressed individuals and families from around the world. In fact, freedom from oppression was one of the ideals on which our nation was founded. Those who face political, religious, personal, and other types of persecution in their home countries commonly seek a safe haven in America. With this in mind, American immigration laws allow such people to petition for asylum, which is often the first step toward lawful permanent residency and eventual citizenship.",

      "According to the immigration laws of the United States, an individual who has fled his or her home nation because of past persecution or a current fear of persecution can apply for a legal status known as “asylum.” In order to be eligible for asylum, the person must be fleeing persecution based on his or her race, religion, nationality, political beliefs, or social group. The person must also believe that returning to his or her country will be unsafe.",
      "If the person is granted asylum by U.S. immigration officials, he or she officially becomes an “asylee.” Recognized asylees are able to petition for lawful permanent resident status—commonly known as a green card—after one year. Once an asylee has obtained a green card, there is a four-year waiting period before the individual can apply to become a U.S. citizen through naturalization.",

      "In the vast majority of cases, a person seeking asylum must apply for asylee status within one year of arriving in the U.S. Technically, exceptions may be granted, but they are extremely rare.
