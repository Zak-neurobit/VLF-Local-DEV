We will work with you to complete the necessary requirements that will protect you from deportation and allow you to become a permanent resident of the United States.\nPresident Trump’s Memo Granting Deferred Enforced Departure\nAs one of his final actions before leaving office, President Trump issued a memorandum that deferred the removal (deportation) of eligible Venezuelan nationals for 18 months following January 20, 2021. This protection for immigration reform was granted through the Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) program, which allows the president of the United States to specify that people who came to the U.S. from certain countries will not be subject to deportation for a certain amount of time. Immigrants who are covered by the DED program may request an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), which will allow them to work for employers in the United States and receive certain public benefits.\nThe DED program applies to citizens of Venezuela or immigrants with no nationality who most recently lived in Venezuela. However, the memo identifies several exceptions to these protections, including:\n\nVenezuelan nationals who have voluntarily returned to Venezuela or the last country where they resided before entering the United States.\nFirst second Immigrants or other immigrants who do not meet the requirements for continuous residence in the United States after January 20, 2021.\nImmigrants who are inadmissible or removable due to concerns about national security.\nThose whose presence in the U.S. would not be in the best interests of the country, according to the Department of Homeland Security, as well as those who present a threat to public safety.\nVenezuelan nationals who have been convicted of a felony or two misdemeanors while in the U.S., as well as those who are subject to extradition.\nLegal or illegal Immigrants who were deported or excluded from entering the United States before January 20, 2021.\nImmigrants whose presence in the U.S. would negatively affect the United States’ foreign policy, according to the U.S. Secretary of State.\n\nContact Our Johnston County Immigration Attorneys\nIf you have come to the United States from Venezuela, you may be worried that you could be deported and required to return to a dangerous situation that may threaten the safety and well-being of your family. While President Trump’s actions have provided temporary protection from deportation, you will likely want to determine how you can remain in the U.S. on a more permanent basis. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our professional immigration lawyers can help you meet the requirements for permanent residence, and we will provide you with affordable legal help and representation throughout the immigration process.

      "Over the past several years, the country of Venezuela has experienced a humanitarian crisis that has affected millions of people due to shortages of food, medicine, and other basic goods. Those who have been forced to flee the country and seek refuge in the United States have been concerned about their immigration court case status, and many have been living under the threat of deportation, which would put them and their families at risk if they were required to return to Venezuela. Fortunately, President Trump took action before leaving office to protect many Venezuelan immigrants from deportation and ensure that they can continue living and working in the U.S.",
      "While Venezuelans living in the United States may currently have protections, they will want to be sure to take the right steps to ensure that they are authorized to work and that they will be able to remain in the U.S. The immigration attorneys at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC can provide legal help in these situations, and with over 35 years of combined experience, we can advise you of your rights and options. We will work with you to complete the necessary requirements that will protect you from deportation and allow you to become a permanent resident of the United States.",
      "As one of his final actions before leaving office, President Trump issued a memorandum that deferred the removal (deportation) of eligible Venezuelan nationals for 18 months following January 20, 2021. This protection for immigration reform was granted through the Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) program, which allows the president of the United States to specify that people who came to the U.S. from certain countries will not be subject to deportation for a certain amount of time. Immigrants who are covered by the DED program may request an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), which will allow them to work for employers in the United States and receive certain public benefits.",
      "The DED program applies to citizens of Venezuela or immigrants with no nationality who most recently lived in Venezuela. However, the memo identifies several exceptions to these protections, including:",
      "If you have come to the United States from Venezuela, you may be worried that you could be deported and required to return to a dangerous situation that may threaten the safety and well-being of your family. While President Trump’s actions have provided temporary protection from deportation, you will likely want to determine how you can remain in the U.S. on a more permanent basis. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our professional immigration lawyers can help you meet the requirements for permanent residence, and we will provide you with affordable legal help and representation throughout the immigration process.
