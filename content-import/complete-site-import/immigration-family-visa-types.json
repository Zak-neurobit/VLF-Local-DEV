At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our lawyers are well aware of the difficulties and challenges that many would-be immigrants face in their efforts to enter and stay in the United States legally.  With more than 35 years of combined experience, our team has the knowledge, resources, and skills to help our clients address even the most complicated immigration concerns. \nThere are many reasons that a foreign national might wish to come to the United States. Some want to come to the U.S. to work or attend school on a temporary basis. Others are seeking a new life altogether and want to start down the path toward lawful permanent resident status and, eventually, U.S. citizenship. At our firm, we are especially committed to helping those who wish to come to the U.S. for family-related reasons. \nSmithfield Counsel for Family Immigrant Visas\nUnder the immigration laws of the United States, there are two primary types of visas: non-immigrant visas and immigrant visas. Non-immigrant visas are granted to eligible foreign citizens who have been approved to enter and remain in the U.S. temporarily. Some common types of non-immigrant visas include student visas, tourist visas, and employment-related visas. \nA foreign national who wishes to come to the United States and live here permanently must obtain an immigrant visa. Immigrant visas are available for a variety of reasons and situations, with family visas being among the most common. In order for a foreign citizen to obtain a family-based immigrant visa, he or she must be sponsored by a relative who is at least 21 years old and is either a lawful permanent resident or a U.S. citizen. \nTypes of Family Visas\nAccording to the United States Department of State, there are two sub-types of family-related immigrant visas. The appropriate visa for a given situation will depend on the status of the sponsor and the sponsor’s relationship to the applicant. The two categories of family-based immigrant visas are:\n\nImmediate Relative Visas: These types of visas are available to close family members of a U.S. citizen sponsor. This includes spouses, children under the age of 21, and the sponsor’s parents. The United States government puts no limit on the number of immediate relative visas in a given year.\nFamily Preference Visas: These types of visas are available to more distant—but specifically defined—family relationships with a U.S. citizen and certain relationships with a lawful permanent resident (green card holder). Family preference visas are limited by the U.S. government in a given year. \n\nThere is a third category of visas that are not officially recognized as family visas but would be considered family-related by the average person. K-visas, also called “fiancé visas,” are available to eligible individuals who are engaged to U.S. citizens and green card holders. Fiancé visas are not limited annually, but they are subject to being revoked if the marriage is not finalized or is found to be fraudulent. \nFinding the Right Family Visa\nIf you have a family member living abroad that you wish to bring into the United States on a family immigrant visa, the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC is here to help. We will sit down with you to discuss your situation and determine the right type of visa that your loved one will need.

      "The United States is a nation that is populated by immigrants from throughout the world and their descendants. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our lawyers are well aware of the difficulties and challenges that many would-be immigrants face in their efforts to enter and stay in the United States legally.  With more than 35 years of combined experience, our team has the knowledge, resources, and skills to help our clients address even the most complicated immigration concerns.",
      "There are many reasons that a foreign national might wish to come to the United States. Some want to come to the U.S. to work or attend school on a temporary basis. Others are seeking a new life altogether and want to start down the path toward lawful permanent resident status and, eventually, U.S. citizenship. At our firm, we are especially committed to helping those who wish to come to the U.S. for family-related reasons.",
      "Under the immigration laws of the United States, there are two primary types of visas: non-immigrant visas and immigrant visas. Non-immigrant visas are granted to eligible foreign citizens who have been approved to enter and remain in the U.S. temporarily. Some common types of non-immigrant visas include student visas, tourist visas, and employment-related visas.",
      "A foreign national who wishes to come to the United States and live here permanently must obtain an immigrant visa. Immigrant visas are available for a variety of reasons and situations, with family visas being among the most common. In order for a foreign citizen to obtain a family-based immigrant visa, he or she must be sponsored by a relative who is at least 21 years old and is either a lawful permanent resident or a U.S. citizen.",
      "According to the United States Department of State, there are two sub-types of family-related immigrant visas. The appropriate visa for a given situation will depend on the status of the sponsor and the sponsor’s relationship to the applicant. The two categories of family-based immigrant visas are:",
      "There is a third category of visas that are not officially recognized as family visas but would be considered family-related by the average person. K-visas, also called “fiancé visas,” are available to eligible individuals who are engaged to U.S. citizens and green card holders. Fiancé visas are not limited annually, but they are subject to being revoked if the marriage is not finalized or is found to be fraudulent.",
      "If you have a family member living abroad that you wish to bring into the United States on a family immigrant visa, the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC is here to help. We will sit down with you to discuss your situation and determine the right type of visa that your loved one will need. From there, our lawyers will guide you through the application process to ensure that everything is completed properly. Our team is committed to helping you provide new opportunities for your family, no matter what challenges may arise.",
