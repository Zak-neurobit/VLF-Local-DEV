Such benefits can cover medical expenses related to their injuries as well as some of their lost wages.However, many farm workers are temporary or contract-based employees who are not always eligible for the same coverage. In such cases, there are other options available. For example, they could bring a personal injury claim against their employer or a third party that was involved. To do so, they would need to demonstrate that their injury was caused by someone else’s negligence or actions.</p>\n<h2>Schedule a Free Consultation with a Wake County, NC Workers’ Compensation Lawyer</h2>\n<p>If you are a farm worker who got hurt on the job, speak with a qualified&nbsp;<a href=\"../contact.html\">Raleigh, NC work injury attorney</a>&nbsp;to understand your options.
