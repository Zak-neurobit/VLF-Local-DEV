By receiving protection against&nbsp;<a style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600;\" href=\"../immigration/deportation-removal-defense.html\">deportation</a>, immigrant victims can leave abusive situations and seek safety for themselves and their families.

This law allows victims of abuse (including women, men, and children) to seek safety and independence from their abusive family members without fear of deportation.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A person may be eligible for a&nbsp;<a style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600;\" href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/abused-spouses-children-and-parents\">VAWA self-petition</a>&nbsp;if they meet the following criteria:</p>\n<ul style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<li>The immigrant must have a qualifying relationship with a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident who has been accused of engaging in acts of abuse. The immigrant may be the abuser’s spouse or child. A parent may qualify under VAWA if they have been subject to abuse by an adult child who is over the age of 21.</li>\n<li>The abuser committed battery or other forms of extreme cruelty against the immigrant or their child during the qualifying relationship.</li>\n<li>The immigrant is currently residing in the same home as their abuser or resided with them in the past.</li>\n<li>The immigrant must demonstrate that they have good moral character. This generally means that they must not have committed any “crimes of moral turpitude,” such as violent crimes, sex crimes, prostitution, etc.</li>\n<li>An immigrant who is married to a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident must show that they entered into their marriage in good faith and had not gotten married in order to obtain immigration benefits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Intersection Between VAWA Protection and Deportation Proceedings</h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, an immigrant victim’s application under VAWA may not prevent them from being placed in removal proceedings. This can happen if the victim is found to be inadmissible or removable for reasons unrelated to their abuse, such as criminal convictions or immigration violations.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, even if an immigrant victim is placed in removal proceedings, they may still have options to fight deportation and remain in the United States. It may be possible to obtain a&nbsp;<a style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600;\" href=\"../immigration/inadmissibility-waivers-ineligible-to-immigrate.html\">waiver of inadmissibility</a>&nbsp;and demonstrate that deportation would cause extreme hardship for a family member who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident. It is crucial for victims to consult with an experienced immigration attorney who can assess their eligibility for relief and represent them throughout the legal process.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contact Our Wake County VAWA Self-Petition Lawyers</h2>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are an immigrant who has been a victim of domestic violence or other types of crimes, it is important to understand your rights and your options for avoiding deportation.
