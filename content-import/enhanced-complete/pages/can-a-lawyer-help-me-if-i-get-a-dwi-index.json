    "ogDescription": " Driving while intoxicated by drugs or alcohol is something that few people would admit to doing. However, studies suggest as many as one in four people have driven under the influence of alcohol or other substances. Some DWI arrests are the result of a poor decision while other times, faulty breath testing devices or other issues lead to an unjustified DWI arrest. If you were charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI), you may also be very nervous about the consequences you face for your actions. While this is natural, it is also important to know that the legal consequences for something like a DWI are rarely set in stone. The advocacy of a great attorney can help you fight the charges and possibly even get them dropped. What Can an Attorney Do in My Defense? Depending on the facts of the case, an attorney has several options available for fighting the charges.
