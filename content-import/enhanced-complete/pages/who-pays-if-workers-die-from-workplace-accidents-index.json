These policies pay<a href=\"https://files.nc.gov/ncoshr/documents/files/Workers-Comp-Employee-Handbook-2018-11-28.pdf\">&nbsp;specific benefits</a>&nbsp;to workers who become ill or injured on the job, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Medical expenses</li>\n<li>A portion of lost wages</li>\n<li>Temporary or permanent disability benefits</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If an employee dies because of a work-related injury or illness, eligible survivors can receive<a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute/97-38.htm\">&nbsp;workers’ comp death benefits</a>. When workers or their families accept workers’ comp benefits, they usually enter a tacit agreement not to pursue personal injury or wrongful death claims against the employer.

Injuries range from repetitive motion injuries and broken bones to spinal cord damage, brain injuries, and fatalities.</p>\n<p>Although workers do not have to prove fault to receive workers’ comp benefits, establishing why an accident happened may give grounds for additional compensation through a personal injury or wrongful death claim. Examples of third-party liability include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Manufacturers</strong>&nbsp;may be liable for defective parts or equipment.</li>\n<li>Although you may work for a company contracted to perform work,&nbsp;<strong>landowners</strong>&nbsp;might be liable for injuries due to work done on their property.</li>\n<li>If your job duties involve driving,&nbsp;<strong>another motorist</strong>&nbsp;could be at fault for a motor vehicle collision that injures you.</li>\n<li>If several crews working for multiple companies are on a job site simultaneously,&nbsp;<strong>another company</strong>&nbsp;may be liable.</li>\n<li>If a delivery company employee injures you in your office, the&nbsp;<strong>employee and his employer</strong>&nbsp;might be at fault.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is impossible to determine whether you can file additional claims and who should pay until your attorney from Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC investigates the circumstances surrounding your workplace injury or your loved one’s death.
