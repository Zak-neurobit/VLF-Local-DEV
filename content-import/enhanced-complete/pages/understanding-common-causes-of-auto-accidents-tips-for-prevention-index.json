It’s important to understand what commonly causes these accidents, as well as ways to prevent them from occurring altogether. This blog aims to shed light on the factors that contribute to auto accidents, as well as some tips for keeping yourself and others safe when you’re behind the wheel. Common Causes Of Auto Accidents  Distracted Driving Distracted driving is defined as anything that takes a driver’s attention away from the road. It can lead to serious injury, but it can also be fatal. Between 2010 and 2019, distracted driving claimed at least 3,000 lives a year. There are three different types of distracted driving: manual, taking your hands off the wheel; visual, taking your eyes off the road; and cognitive, taking your mind off driving. One of the most prominent and frequent ways people drive distracted today involves all three of these types; texting. The NHTSA says that sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds.

It can lead to serious injury, but it can also be fatal. Between 2010 and 2019, distracted driving claimed at least&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/distracted_driving/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3,000&nbsp;</a>lives a year.</p>\n<p>There are three different types of distracted driving: manual, taking your hands off the wheel; visual, taking your eyes off the road; and cognitive, taking your mind off driving. One of the most prominent and frequent ways people drive distracted today involves all three of these types; texting. The NHTSA says that sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds. If you’re driving at&nbsp;55 mph, that’s comparable to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/distracted-driving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">driving the length of a football field</a>&nbsp;with your eyes<strong>&nbsp;closed.</strong></p>\n<p>There are several other ways to participate in distracted driving besides texting, like reaching for something in the back seat, glancing over at or engaging in deep conversation with a passenger, changing the radio station, or even mentally checking out while driving.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips For Avoiding Distractions While Driving</strong></p>\n<p>There are numerous ways to avoid distractions when behind the wheel, including, but not limited, to the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If texting or scrolling on your phone is a temptation, stow your phone away where you cannot access it while driving.</li>\n<li>Put away any loose items that might roll around or fall and cause you to become unfocused.</li>\n<li>Make sure you’re ready for your day before you get in the car. Applying makeup or using any grooming tools while on the road is dangerous.</li>\n<li>Make sure pets are secured.</li>\n<li>If you’re someone who is easily distracted by conversation or the presence of others, consider limiting the amount of people you let into your vehicle.</li>\n<li>Should there be anything that requires your immediate attention while driving, a child, a pet, or emergency phone call, be sure to pull off to a safe spot and park before diverting your attention.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Speeding</strong></p>\n<p>Speeding is another common cause of auto accidents that can have serious consequences. It is considered an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/speeding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aggressive driving behavior</a>&nbsp;caused by a variety of different things like traffic, running late, anonymity (being detached from the environment around you), and general disregard for others or the laws.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/speedmgt/ref_mats/fhwasa1304/Resources3/08%20-%20The%20Relation%20Between%20Speed%20and%20Crashes.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crash rate increases</a>&nbsp;as a driver increases their speed. This means that the faster you go, the more likely it is that an accident might occur. It also makes the injuries sustained more severe.</p>\n<p>It is said that for every 10 mph of increased speed, the risk of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.emcins.com/losscontrol/insights-d/2020/08/speed-increases-risk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dying in a crash doubles.</a>&nbsp;So it’s not only more likely that a crash can occur, but that the repercussions will be much more damaging. This notion is based on physics – Newton’s law, centrifugal force, kinetic energy, vehicle mass and velocity.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips For Maintaining Safe Speed Limits</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relax before driving. If there is something stressing you or making you angry, try to decompress before embarking on your journey. Those who drive angry are likely to exceed the speed limit by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apa.org/topics/anger/road-rage#:~:text=High%2Danger%20drivers%20are%20more,faster%20and%20behave%20more%20aggressively.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">10-20mph.</a></li>\n<li>Make sure you leave with enough time to get to your destination. Often people speed because they’re running late. By giving yourself more than enough time to get to your destination, you can eliminate the so-called “need for speed.”</li>\n<li>If you know you have an issue with speeding, working with a car insurance company that offers low rates for safe drivers could be a great incentive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Driving Under the Influence</strong></p>\n<p>Driving under the influence of alcohol is another common cause of auto accidents with grave physical and legal consequences. In the U.S. about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">37 people die&nbsp;</a>a day as a result of drunk driving. It is illegal across the United States to drive with a BAC (blood alcohol concentration) of .08 or higher, however, even the smallest bit of alcohol can impair one’s driving abilities. When someone drives drunk, they can not only injure themselves, but others as well. Not to mention the legal repercussions that can ensue, like being arrested, fined, and having your license suspended. If you were to cause the death of someone else, you’ll likely face much more rigorous consequences.</p>\n<p><strong>Tips For Preventing Driving While Intoxicated</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The number one tip for not driving under the influence is just to simply never do it. If you go out alone, you should plan not to drink or appoint a designated driver like a friend, or even an Uber. Remember drunk driving is a dangerous and illegal act. Consider the implications before you get behind the wheel intoxicated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In conclusion, it’s important to understand the common causes of auto accidents discussed. By educating yourself on the factors like distracted driving, speeding, and driving under the influence, you can take a proactive approach in avoiding the causes and the mistakes that lead to auto accidents. By practicing the discussed tips, you can protect not only yourself, but others on the road as well. Driving is a privilege, and safe driving is a responsibility.
