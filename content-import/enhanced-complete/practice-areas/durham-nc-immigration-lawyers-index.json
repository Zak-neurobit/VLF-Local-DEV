Immigrating to the United States is not an easy process – it calls for a lot of paperwork, meeting eligibility requirements, legal procedures, tests, and most of all, time. On top of everything else, language and cultural barriers can make the process even more complicated.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether your goals for immigration are to obtain a temporary work visa, to fight deportation, or to become a naturalized citizen, you will need skilled legal assistance to get the best outcome. The </span><a href=\"../index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Durham immigration lawyers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at Vasquez Law Firm are experienced in helping people – particularly families – establish a life in the U.S. Reach out to schedule a free consultation and learn about the variety of issues that we can help you overcome.</span></p>\n<p><b>Immigration Legal Focuses</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Immigration law has many facets, and there are many steps on the journey to naturalized citizenship. Not everyone has the same goals for their immigration journey, and our Durham immigration lawyers are prepared to offer you our skilled assistance in the areas that you need. Our focuses include, but are not limited to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Visas:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are several categories and subcategories of visas. </span><b>Immigrant visas </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are for people who intend to live permanently in the U.S. while </span><b>non-immigrant visas</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are for people who are staying in the U.S. temporarily. Non-immigrant visas include types for tourism, work, education, and others.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Green cards:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A green card is an important step in the journey toward full citizenship. When you are issued a green card, you are granted full legal status, meaning that you can legally live and work in the U.S. There are several ways to obtain a green card – for example, being sponsored by a resident family member or employer, or applying for legal asylum.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Deportation appeals:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Also called “removal proceedings,” deportation is the process by which a foreign national is removed from the U.S. You can be subject to removal proceedings for many reasons, including an expired visa or a criminal conviction. When we learn the unique circumstances surrounding your deportation order, our Durham immigration lawyers can craft a strategy to challenge your removal proceedings.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Adjustment of status:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you meet certain criteria and you possess a temporary visa, you can apply for an adjustment of status, which can allow you to obtain a green card.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>DACA:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Signed into law in 2012, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) provides some level of protection for undocumented children who grew up in the U.S. If you meet certain residency criteria, you can apply for DACA relief, which will protect you from deportation and allow you to obtain a driver’s license and other forms of documentation.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Criminal defense:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you have a green card or a visa and you are convicted of a crime, you are at risk of losing these documents and being subject to removal proceedings. If you are accused of a crime, you need to work with one of the Vasquez Law Firm immigration lawyers who understands criminal defense in order to defend your residency here in the U.S.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Naturalization:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you have obtained a green card, you are eligible for the naturalization process, which means that you will be a legal citizen of the United States! The process for naturalization is complex, so it requires the help of an experienced immigration lawyer.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And more!

Our focuses include, but are not limited to:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Visas:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are several categories and subcategories of visas. </span><b>Immigrant visas </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are for people who intend to live permanently in the U.S. while </span><b>non-immigrant visas</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are for people who are staying in the U.S. temporarily. Non-immigrant visas include types for tourism, work, education, and others.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Green cards:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A green card is an important step in the journey toward full citizenship. When you are issued a green card, you are granted full legal status, meaning that you can legally live and work in the U.S. There are several ways to obtain a green card – for example, being sponsored by a resident family member or employer, or applying for legal asylum.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Deportation appeals:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Also called “removal proceedings,” deportation is the process by which a foreign national is removed from the U.S. You can be subject to removal proceedings for many reasons, including an expired visa or a criminal conviction. When we learn the unique circumstances surrounding your deportation order, our Durham immigration lawyers can craft a strategy to challenge your removal proceedings.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Adjustment of status:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you meet certain criteria and you possess a temporary visa, you can apply for an adjustment of status, which can allow you to obtain a green card.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>DACA:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Signed into law in 2012, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) provides some level of protection for undocumented children who grew up in the U.S. If you meet certain residency criteria, you can apply for DACA relief, which will protect you from deportation and allow you to obtain a driver’s license and other forms of documentation.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Criminal defense:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you have a green card or a visa and you are convicted of a crime, you are at risk of losing these documents and being subject to removal proceedings. If you are accused of a crime, you need to work with one of the Vasquez Law Firm immigration lawyers who understands criminal defense in order to defend your residency here in the U.S.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Naturalization:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you have obtained a green card, you are eligible for the naturalization process, which means that you will be a legal citizen of the United States! The process for naturalization is complex, so it requires the help of an experienced immigration lawyer.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And more!
