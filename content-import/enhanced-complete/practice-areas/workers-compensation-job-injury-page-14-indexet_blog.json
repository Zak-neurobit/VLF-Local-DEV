Have your injuries kept you from returning to your job, or are they preventing you from performing your normal daily activities? If the answer to these questions is yes, it is understandable that you might feel anxious and confused over the difficult reality of your situation. Depending on the extent of your injury, you may need many months of medical treatment and rehabilitation, or you may even be permanently disabled. According to the law in North Carolina, most employers are required to carry workers compensation insurance. Unfortunately, just having work comp coverage does not always mean that it will be easy to get the benefits you deserve following an on-the-job injury.</p>\n<p>At the <a href=\"../../../attorneys.html\">Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC</a>, we realize that workers who have been hurt while doing their jobs are usually eligible for workers’ compensation benefits. However, we also understand that companies often make collecting those benefits very challenging. If you have been injured at work, you have suffered enough. You do not deserve to be ignored or mistreated in your attempts to collect the benefits to which you are entitled under the law. Our law firm workers’ compensation has more than 35 years of combined legal experience, and we are committed to helping you get what you need to get back on your feet and back to work as quickly as possible.</p>\n<h3>Protecting the Rights of Injured Workers in Smithfield</h3>\n<p>The knowledgeable team at our workers compensation lawyer firm works hard every day to protect the rights of employees who have been injured on the job. With our background and experience, we recognize that doing so often requires us to stand up to stubborn employers and uncooperative insurance carriers. Our lawyers will not be tricked or intimidated into backing down, and we will not agree to a settlement that fails to account for the full extent of your work-related injuries. We will continue to fight on your behalf until you get the full benefits you deserve.<br>While some industries and occupations have a reputation for being particularly dangerous, we know that work-related accidents and injuries can happen to any employee. Our advocates for injured workers from a full range of jobs, including employees of factories, construction companies, restaurants, retail stores, and offices, just to name a few.<br>The Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC is also prepared to handle any type of work injury with law firm workers compensation, including those caused by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../../lifting-injuries-overexertion.html\">Heavy lifting</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../repetitive-stress-carpal-tunnel.html\">Repetitive motion or repetitive stress</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../equipment-accidents-failures.html\">Equipment failures and accidents</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../construction-site-injuries.html\">Construction site accidents</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our team is also fully aware that work-related accidents can cause more than just physical injuries.

Unfortunately, things do not always work out that way. If your injury is minor—such as a sprained ankle that caused you to miss a single day’s work with no lingering issues—hiring a lawyer to recover that day’s wages might not be necessary. If your ankle was broken and you required a series of surgeries is not being handled properly, an attorney can assist you in sorting out all of the details. It is also best to work with an attorney if you are uncertain about returning to work or if there is the possibility of <a href=\"../../third-party-injury-claims/index.html\">third-party liability</a> for your injuries.</p>\n<h3>Speak With a Member of Our Team for Free</h3>\n<p>To learn more about workers compensation claims in North Carolina, <a href=\"../../../contact.html\">contact us</a> today.
