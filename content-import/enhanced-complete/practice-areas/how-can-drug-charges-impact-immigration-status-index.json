An experienced lawyer can determine whether it would be fitting to challenge whether any evidence against you was obtained legally; negotiate a plea bargain so you end up facing less severe charges that do not carry any deportation consequences; or pursue other options for sentencing that focus on rehabilitation more than punitive measures.</p>\n<p>One of the most important things you can do for your case is make sure to hire an experienced lawyer who has fought similar cases with implications for criminal as well as immigration law. If you might face deportation, you will need an attorney who can offer personalized guidance as well as assistance in assessing potential immigration consequences and someone who can effectively advocate on your behalf in court.</p>\n<h2>Schedule a Free Consultation with a Johnston County, NC Immigration Lawyer</h2>\n<p>If you are concerned you might soon be facing drug charges, which could have serious consequences for your future in America, speak with a knowledgeable&nbsp;<a href=\"../contact.html\">Smithfield, NC immigration attorney</a>&nbsp;to gain a better understanding of what is at stake.
