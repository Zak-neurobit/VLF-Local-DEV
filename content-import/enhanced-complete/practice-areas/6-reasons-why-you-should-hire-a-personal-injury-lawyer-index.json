It is very important that you are not found to be at fault in NC accidents because of the state’s negligence laws. Liable insurers may try to cast blame onto you to avoid paying your claim. We will ensure that any fault assigned to you is fair.</p>\n<h2>Dealing With North Carolina Negligence Laws</h2>\n<p>Every U.S. state has laws that govern the eligibility to obtain compensation after an injury accident. Most states use a form of modified comparative negligence. Although state legislators have made several attempts to<a href=\"https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/H811\">&nbsp;change these statutes</a>, North Carolina remains one of only four states using pure contributory negligence.</p>\n<p>Pure contributory negligence means that if you are even one percent responsible for causing your accident, you cannot obtain compensation from other at-fault parties. This law may make you think you do not have a case. There may be exceptions, and your attorney will work toward a favorable outcome.</p>\n<h2>Calculating Damages</h2>\n<p>If you qualify to obtain compensation, you may be eligible for several kinds of damages. These reimburse or compensate you for accident-related losses. You probably do not know how to value your qualifying damages, which can result in accepting a settlement that does not cover everything. Your lawyer can accurately assess your case’s value.</p>\n<h2>Combatting Insurance Company Tactics</h2>\n<p>Insurance companies would rather protect their bottom lines than pay valid claims. They routinely use unfair tactics to pay you less than you deserve. Arguing with an insurer can be intimidating to most people. Fortunately, Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC will stand up to them; we will not let them take advantage of you.</p>\n<h2>Giving You Peace of Mind</h2>\n<p>Not knowing how to deal with potential challenges in a personal injury claim is upsetting. You may worry that you will miss a vital detail, resulting in a low settlement offer or claim denial. When you work with Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we will do all the heavy lifting. You can rest easy knowing we are fighting to safeguard your best interests.</p>\n<h2>Contact Us Today for Your Free Consultation With Our Knowledgeable Raleigh, NC Personal Injury Lawyers</h2>\n<p>At Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we can help you overcome the challenges you may face with your personal injury claim.
