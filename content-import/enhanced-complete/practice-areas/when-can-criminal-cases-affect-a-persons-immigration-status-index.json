When these waivers are granted, they may allow a person to avoid deportation and apply for a visa or<a href=\"../immigration/green-cards.html\">&nbsp;Green Card</a>. However, waivers are only available for certain types of offenses, and a person will typically need to show that their deportation or refusal of entry to the U.S. would cause extreme hardship for a close family member who is a U.S. citizen or who has a valid Green Card.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Contact Our Charlotte Immigration Lawyers for Criminal Convictions</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are an immigrant facing criminal charges, it is essential to work with an attorney who understands the immigration implications of your case.
