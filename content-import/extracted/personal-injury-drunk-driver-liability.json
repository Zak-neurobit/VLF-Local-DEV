According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in an average year, over 10,000 deaths nationwide are caused by auto accidents involving at least one drunk driver. This figure does not take into account the tens of thousands of others who are injured in drunk driving accidents annually. \nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our skilled personal injury attorneys have helped many clients in North Carolina recover damages for injuries caused by a drunk driver. We understand the challenges that are often involved in these types of cases, and we know what it takes to get results. If you have been injured in a North Carolina drunk driving accident, we are here for you. With more than 35 years of combined legal experience, our team is equipped to help you get the compensation you need to start putting your life back together. \nDWI Accidents and Negligence Per Se in North Carolina\nWhen you have been injured in any type of accident—including a car or truck crash—the first step in obtaining compensation is establishing the party or parties responsible for causing your injuries. In a traffic accident situation, this is known as determining “fault.” In many cases, the at-fault driver was negligent in some way and proving negligence is often difficult. When a drunk driver is involved in a crash, however, establishing negligence tends to get a little easier.\nCourts in North Carolina recognize a legal doctrine known as “negligence per se.” Under this doctrine, a party who violates a statute, safety law, or ordinance and injures another party, as a result, is presumed to have been negligent due to breaking the law. In other words, if a person breaks a safety law and causes a crash in doing so, that person is presumed to be at fault for the accident.\nThis doctrine is especially relevant in alcohol-related crashes, especially if the drunk driver is convicted of driving while impaired (DWI). Any court records pertaining to the conviction can be used as evidence in a personal injury claim for compensation. A defendant who is presumed negligent can overcome the presumption, but it is often difficult to do so.\nCharlotte Attorneys Protecting Your Rights\nEstablishing drunk driver liability is just the first step in getting you the compensation you deserve. You will also need to show the seriousness of the injuries you have sustained and how they are affecting your life. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our experienced lawyers will assist you in compiling an accurate report of your medical costs, lost wages, and other measurable losses. Additionally, we will help you build a case for obtaining reimbursement for pain, suffering, scarring, disfigurement, and emotional distress, as applicable. In some cases, punitive damages may also be available. \nOur knowledgeable attorneys understand that even after liability has been determined, the case is far from over. Insurance companies will often stall and try to minimize their financial exposure by challenging the severity of your injuries or the timeline for your recovery. Our team will not be bullied or tricked into accepting any settlement offer that does not fully meet your needs. Instead, we will fight for you until you get the compensation you need to get back on your feet. \nFree Consultations Are Available\nIf a drunk driver caused an accident in which you or a member of your family was injured, contact our firm to get the help you need today.
