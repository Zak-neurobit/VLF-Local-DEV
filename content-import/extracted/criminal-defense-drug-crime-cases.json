In 1971, President Richard Nixon officially declared “war on drugs,” and in the years that followed, those convicted of drug-related offenses faced increasingly harsh consequences. Today, attitudes regarding some drugs, including marijuana, have relaxed somewhat, but other drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine continue to cause problems in many communities. \nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our attorneys are fully aware that a single drug-related conviction can change your life forever. You could face penalties that include jail time, probation, expensive fines, and a mark on your criminal record that will follow you for the rest of your life. If you are facing any type of misdemeanor or felony drug charges, we are ready to help you. With more than 35 years of combined experience, our lawyers know how to get results, and we will work hard to ensure that your rights and your future are fully protected. \nTrusted North Carolina Criminal Defense Counsel\nIn nearly every drug-related case, the severity of the charges will depend on the type and amount of the drug in question. Your previous criminal record will also be taken into account. Under North Carolina law, drug charges can range from misdemeanor charges for the possession of marijuana or drug paraphernalia up to felony charges for trafficking of so-called “hard” drugs such as heroin and methamphetamines. It is important to understand, however, that there is no such thing as a minor drug case in North Carolina. A drug-related criminal charge is always serious, and you should have a qualified attorney at your side. \nAt the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our knowledgeable criminal defense lawyers can help you build a defense against whatever drug charges you may be facing, including:\n\nPossession of an illegal drug\nPossession with intent to sell or distribute\nTrafficking and distribution\nManufacturing a controlled substance\nPrescription drug fraud and illegal possession\nMarijuana-related offenses\n\nThe skilled attorneys at our firm have the experience and resources to fully analyze the circumstances surrounding your arrest and to build a case to help you avoid a conviction. Our team has successfully represented many clients facing drug charges, and we are ready to put our client-first approach to work for you.  \nCharlotte Drug Crime Lawyers Protecting Your Constitutional Rights\nThe prosecution of a drug crime case is usually dependent on the physical evidence obtained by the police before an arrest is made. Such evidence often includes the drug itself, along with paraphernalia or supplies that could suggest an intent to sell. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides protection for citizens against unlawful searches and seizures, but illegal searches are not uncommon. If the evidence against you was found during an unlawful search of your home, car, or personal effects, our lawyers will work to get your charges reduced or dismissed altogether.\nWhen you choose to work with the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, you become part of a team that is dedicated to protecting your best interests. In order to do so, we pledge to be honest with you about your case, even when the truth is not easy to hear. For example, we recognize that in certain situations, your best option may be to negotiate with prosecutors to secure a plea deal that minimizes the impact on your future. Depending on the nature and the severity of the charges, you may be eligible for diversion programs or other alternatives that could allow you to avoid having a conviction on your permanent record. When appropriate, however, we are fully prepared to defend your innocence at trial. No matter how challenging your case may be, you can depend on us to remain at your side every step of the way. \nContact Our Office Today\nPenalties for a drug conviction can range from fines and probation up to decades in prison, so it is crucial to have an experienced North Carolina drug crime defense attorney on your side. If you or someone you love is facing drug charges, contact our office. Call  or 919-626-8450 to schedule a free, no-obligation consultation with one of our attorneys today.
