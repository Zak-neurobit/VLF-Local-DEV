The federal laws that apply to family-based immigration can be complex and confusing, especially with recent immigration reform efforts, and it can be challenging to understand and meet the law’s requirements. This is why it is so important to work closely with a qualified family-based immigration attorney as you seek to offer a better life and new opportunities to your loved ones. We have the experience, knowledge, and resources to help you obtain the necessary visas for your family members in a variety of circumstances or situations.\nThe skilled attorneys at our firm have over 35 years of combined experience in handling family-related immigration matters, including working with first-generation immigrants. We know how to anticipate and address potential issues in advance so that they do not become serious obstacles. Our team is dedicated to helping you secure a favorable result for your family member, no matter the challenges that may arise.\nImmigration Counsel for Families in North Carolina\nThe area of family-based immigration encompasses a wide range of cases in which United States citizens and lawful permanent residents (“green card” holders) seek to bring their family members and future spouses to the U.S. legally. According to U.S. immigration law, lawful permanent residents and legal citizens can serve as sponsors to help their relatives obtain permanent or temporary visas.\nThis process is critical for families affected by illegal immigration concerns or those looking to assist loved ones in avoiding legal complications.\nGenerally, the application process for family-based immigration is relatively straightforward. The process begins when a citizen or permanent resident files a completed Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) with the primary immigration agency of the U.S. government: United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, also known as USCIS. Once the petition is accepted by USCIS, the petitioner will be notified of a date after which the family members in question can apply for visas or green cards.\nJohnson County Lawyers Who Understand the Preference System for Family-Based Immigration\nThe United States government allows for approving a limited number of family visas and permanent resident status applications in a given year. Therefore, a preference system has been created for processing family immigration requests, even if you are hiring an immigration lawyer. Legal spouses, minor children, and parents of current U.S. citizens over 21 are immediate relatives, which means they are not included in the family preference system.\nApplications for other relatives, however, are considered in order based on the status of the petitioner and the relationship:\n\nFirst preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their unmarried children over the age of 21.\nSecond preference is given to petitions filed by permanent residents for their spouses and children. Minor children receive preference over adult children.\nThird, preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their married children and the immediate relatives of their married children.\nFourth, preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their siblings and the immediate relatives of their siblings.\n\nSmithfield Lawyers for Fiancé Visas\nIf you are a U.S. citizen or green card holder engaged to a foreign national, it may be possible to obtain a K-visa to bring your fiancé to the U.S. so you can get married. A K-visa might also be helpful if you already married a foreign national abroad, but your spouse has not yet received his or her green card. K-visas are commonly called “fiancé visas,” and they are not permanent. Your future spouse’s K-visa can be revoked if you never finalize the marriage or if your marriage is dissolved through divorce or annulment. It’s important to consult with an experienced immigration lawyer to understand how immigration reform might affect this process.\nWork with a Knowledgeable North Carolina Immigration Lawyer\nNew immigration law can be complicated, and you may have several options for legally bringing your relatives or your fiancé to the United States. At Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we will meet with you to discuss your situation and to determine the best way to meet your needs.
