As three-wheel models gain popularity, motorcycles appeal to men and women of all ages. Unfortunately, some riders are not as careful as others, as they weave in and out of traffic. As a result, biases exist against motorcyclists in general, so when an accident involving a motorcycle occurs, the blame is often placed on the rider even if he or she was riding safely. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our skilled North Carolina personal injury attorneys are committed to helping injured motorcycle riders get the full compensation they deserve following an accident. \nDedicated Johnston County Personal Injury Attorneys\nA motorcycle accident can change your life forever in just a matter of a few seconds. The size and weight difference between motorcycles and other vehicles, in addition to the vulnerability of an exposed motorcycle rider, can lead to tragic and devastating results in a crash. In fact, motorcycle riders are almost 30 times more likely to be killed and five times more likely to be injured in an accident than occupants of cars and trucks (per vehicle mile driven). \nThe lawyers at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC recognize that motorcycle accidents can occur as the result of many different factors. We know that motorcycles are often difficult for other drivers to see due to their relatively small size and visual profile, but that does not excuse careless driving. When the driver of a car or truck fails to recognize an approaching motorcycle, it is usually the rider who pays the price. Our attorneys believe that negligent drivers must be held accountable, and we are prepared to help you do just that. \nProtecting Victims’ Rights in Smithfield\nThe team at our law firm has more than 35 years of combined personal injury experience, and our commitment to you begins immediately. We understand the importance of conducting a full review of the crash, as well as the circumstances that led to it. Our attorneys will investigate the situation, looking for any and all parties who may share in the liability for your injuries. We will also take the time to meet with you as often as necessary to gain a comprehensive understanding of your injuries and how they are affecting your life. This can also allow us to coordinate your medical care so that you can focus on making a full physical recovery.  \nOur attorneys are thorough, knowledgeable, and skilled professionals who know how to get the best possible results. Once we have gathered all of the relevant information, we will work with you in developing a strategy for managing your case. We understand that most motorcycle accident claims are resolved by settlements offered by insurance companies, but the road to a resolution is not always an easy one. It is not uncommon for insurers to attempt to avoid large payouts by trying to shift the blame for the accident to you, especially if you were riding your motorcycle. The insurance company might also dispute the extent of your injuries to reduce its potential financial exposure. \nThe good news is that we know the games that insurance companies often play, and we are not afraid to stand up to them. We will negotiate in good faith toward a settlement, but we are fully prepared to take your case to trial if necessary. Our lawyers have recovered millions of dollars in verdicts and settlements for our clients, and we are ready to put our proven approach to work for you and your family. \nOur Team Is Here to Help\nTo learn more about our law firm and how we can help you obtain maximum compensation following a motorcycle accident, contact our office.
