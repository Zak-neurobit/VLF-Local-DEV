The reality is that a divorce will probably affect almost every aspect of your life to at least some extent, and the overall impact may be totally overwhelming.\nAt Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our primary goal is to help you manage the process of divorce so that you can begin building a healthier, happier new life. With over 35 years of combined legal experience, our lawyers understand that challenges and obstacles will almost certainly come up during your divorce, but we are equipped to help you overcome them. We will work closely with you in developing a strategy for your divorce that meets your needs and protects your rights. \nTrusted Divorce Counsel in North Carolina\nWhile many divorces share similarities, no two cases are exactly the same. Every case has its own unique circumstances and issues to be addressed. When a couple can cooperate and communicate, it may be possible to get through the process quickly and without the need for extensive negotiations. If the spouses cannot communicate, or they are dealing with concerns such as instances of domestic violence, litigation might be the only path to a resolution. \nThe good news is that our attorneys have the knowledge, resources, and tools to help you regardless of the circumstances surrounding your situation. We can assist in amicable divorce cases by facilitating negotiations, reviewing the terms of your settlement, and filing your paperwork with the court. In more contentious situations, we are prepared to litigate on your behalf during courtroom hearings and at trial. You can depend on us to provide the guidance you need and the personalized representation you deserve.\nFinancial Questions in a Smithfield Divorce\nFinances are a common source of disagreement between married spouses, and battles over money can easily lead a couple to pursue a divorce. Money and property concerns during a divorce can cause the proceedings to turn bitter and drag on for many months. At the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, our lawyers help divorcing couples craft creative solutions to their most difficult financial disagreements. We can assist you and your spouse with:\n\nDividing marital property and debt equitably\nOrders for alimony\nPost-separation support\nFinding hidden assets and income\nPersonal asset protection\n\nOur lawyers know that property concerns in a divorce are often complicated, but we will do everything we can to simplify the process for you. We will ensure that you have the resources that you need to begin the next chapter of your life. \nJohnston County Attorneys for Parents Seeking a Divorce\nYour divorce is likely to be even more complicated if you and your spouse have children. When there are children involved, their best interests and well-being must be considered in every decision that is made. Divorcing parents in North Carolina are encouraged to work together in raising their children after a divorce, but doing so requires preparation and commitment to cooperation. \nOur attorneys will work with you in developing reasonable arrangements for child custody and visitation that allow both you and your spouse remain active in the lives of your children. We can also help you fight to protect your parental rights if an amicable resolution is not possible. In addition, we can assist you in any proceedings regarding child support and post-decree modifications. \nWe Are Here to Help You\nWhen you choose to work with Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, you get more than an attorney.
