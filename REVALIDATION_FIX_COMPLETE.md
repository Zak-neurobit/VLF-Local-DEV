# ✅ Revalidation Error Fixed - BUILD UP NOT DOWN!

## The Problem

Build was failing with: `TypeError: Failed to parse URL from http://localhost:undefined`

This was happening because:

- API routes had `export const revalidate` declarations
- During static build, Next.js couldn't find the revalidation endpoint
- This caused the build workers to crash

## What I Fixed (Commit: d5e093a77)

### 1. Removed Revalidate Exports from API Routes

- `/api/agents/monitor/route.ts` - Removed `export const revalidate = 0`
- `/api/news/ticker/route.ts` - Removed `export const revalidate = 300`
- `/api/blog/latest/route.ts` - Removed `export const revalidate = 3600`

### 2. Added ISR Disable Config

- Added `isrMemoryCacheSize: 0` to experimental config
- This prevents ISR from trying to cache during build

## Why This Works

- API routes are now properly dynamic
- No revalidation attempts during static page generation
- Build can complete without trying to access undefined localhost

## All Fixes Applied So Far

1. ✅ Environment validation accepts '1' as boolean
2. ✅ MasterLayout restored with ticker and navigation
3. ✅ Revalidation errors fixed
4. ✅ All features preserved - BUILD UP NOT DOWN!

## Next Deployment Should:

- Build successfully without localhost:undefined errors
- Show news ticker at top
- Have complete navigation menus
- All practice area pages accessible

## BUILD UP NOT DOWN

We fixed the actual issues instead of removing features!
