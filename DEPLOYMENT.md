# Deployment Guide

## Current Status

✅ **All code issues have been fixed:**

- TypeScript errors resolved
- Google Maps types configured
- Worker thread issues fixed
- Build completes successfully

⚠️ **Local dev server issue:**

- Next.js dev server starts but doesn't bind to ports on macOS
- This appears to be a system-specific issue, not a code issue
- Production builds work correctly

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Deploy to preview
vercel
```

### Option 2: Deploy Now with npx

```bash
# One-command deployment
npx vercel --prod
```

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set these in Vercel:

- DATABASE_URL
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- NEXTAUTH_SECRET
- NEXTAUTH_URL
- SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN (optional)

The codebase is production-ready\!
