        <h2 id="truck-accidents">üöõ Truck Accident Claims</h2>

        <p>
          Commercial truck accidents often result in catastrophic injuries due to the massive size and weight differences between trucks and passenger vehicles. These cases involve complex federal regulations and multiple liable parties.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Truck Accidents Are More Serious</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Size and Weight:</strong> Trucks can weigh up to 80,000 pounds vs. 3,000 for cars</li>
          <li><strong>Stopping Distance:</strong> Trucks need much more distance to stop safely</li>
          <li><strong>Blind Spots:</strong> Large "no-zones" where cars are invisible to truck drivers</li>
          <li><strong>Jackknifing:</strong> Trailer can swing around and cause multi-vehicle accidents</li>
          <li><strong>Rollover Risk:</strong> High center of gravity makes trucks prone to rollovers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Federal Trucking Regulations</h3>
        <p>
          Truck drivers and companies must follow strict federal regulations:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hours of Service:</strong> Limits on driving time to prevent fatigue</li>
          <li><strong>Vehicle Maintenance:</strong> Required inspections and maintenance schedules</li>
          <li><strong>Driver Qualifications:</strong> Commercial driver's license and medical requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Drug and Alcohol Testing:</strong> Random testing and post-accident testing</li>
          <li><strong>Electronic Logging:</strong> Electronic tracking of driving hours</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Multiple Liable Parties in Truck Accidents</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Truck Driver:</strong> For negligent driving, fatigue, or violations</li>
          <li><strong>Trucking Company:</strong> For hiring, training, or supervision failures</li>
          <li><strong>Vehicle Owner:</strong> If different from trucking company</li>
          <li><strong>Maintenance Company:</strong> For improper repairs or maintenance</li>
          <li><strong>Cargo Loader:</strong> For improper loading causing accidents</li>
          <li><strong>Manufacturer:</strong> For defective truck parts or design</li>

        <h2>‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>How much is my personal injury case worth?</h3>
        <p>
          The value depends on many factors including the severity of your injuries, impact on your life, medical expenses, lost wages, and degree of fault. We provide free case evaluations to give you an honest assessment.
        </p>

        <h3>How long does a personal injury case take?</h3>
        <p>
          Cases can settle in months or take years if they go to trial. The timeline depends on the complexity of your case, the severity of your injuries, and the insurance company's willingness to negotiate fairly.
        </p>

        <h3>What if I can't afford an attorney?</h3>
        <p>
          We work on a contingency fee basis, meaning you pay nothing unless we win your case. We advance all costs and expenses, so you can get quality representation regardless of your financial situation.
        </p>

        <h3>Should I accept the insurance company's first offer?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>NO.</strong> First offers are typically far below what your case is worth. Insurance companies hope you'll accept quickly before understanding the full extent of your injuries and damages.
        </p>

        <h3>What if the accident was partially my fault?</h3>
        <p>
          North Carolina's contributory negligence rule is harsh, but there are exceptions and strategies to overcome it. Even if you think you were partially at fault, you should still consult with an attorney.
        </p>

        <h3>Do I have to go to court?</h3>
        <p>
          Most personal injury cases settle out of court. However, we're always prepared to go to trial if that's what's necessary to get you fair compensation. Having trial-ready attorneys often leads to better settlement offers.
