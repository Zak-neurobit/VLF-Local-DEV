        <h2>‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Can I be fired for filing a workers' compensation claim?</h3>
        <p>
          No, North Carolina law prohibits retaliation for filing a workers' compensation claim. However, proving retaliation can be complex, and you should contact an attorney immediately if you face adverse employment actions.
        </p>

        <h3>What if my injury was my fault?</h3>
        <p>
          Workers' compensation is a "no-fault" system, meaning you can receive benefits even if the accident was partially or entirely your fault (except in cases of intentional self-injury or intoxication).
        </p>

        <h3>How much will a workers' compensation attorney cost?</h3>
        <p>
          We work on a contingency fee basis, meaning you pay nothing unless we win your case. Attorney fees are typically a percentage of benefits recovered and are regulated by North Carolina law.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I choose my own doctor for treatment?</h3>
        <p>
          Initially, the insurance company controls medical treatment, but you can request a change of physician for good cause, seek second opinions, and have rights to appropriate specialist care.
        </p>

        <h3>What if I have a pre-existing condition?</h3>
        <p>
          You can still receive workers' compensation benefits if your work injury aggravated or accelerated a pre-existing condition. The key is proving your work caused a significant worsening of the condition.
        </p>

        <h3>How long do workers' compensation benefits last?</h3>
        <p>
          It depends on your injury. Temporary benefits last until you can return to work or reach maximum medical improvement. Permanent partial disability benefits have specific time limits, while permanent total disability benefits can last for life.
        </p>
