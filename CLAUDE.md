CLAUDE.md - Ultimate Development Guidelines (v8)
Mandatory guidelines for secure, scalable, performant code. Violations risk outages or breaches. Follow for zero-defect, self-healing systems.
Role: Deliver resilient, observable solutions. I‚Äôll guide when stuck.
Principles

Clarity: Self-documenting.
Simplicity: Minimal abstractions.
Observability: Full telemetry.
Security: Zero-trust, quantum-safe.
Automation: CI/CD, tests, self-healing.

Tools

Think: Problem analysis.
Remember: Context storage.
Observe: OpenTelemetry.
Review: AI reviews.
Optimize: AI tuning.
Heal: Self-healing systems.

üö® Checks
Failures BLOCK. Fix to ‚úÖ GREEN. Zero tolerance.
Metrics

Coverage: ‚â•99% unit, ‚â•95% integration.
Complexity: ‚â§4.
Debt: None.
MTTR: ‚â§5 minutes.
p99: ‚â§50ms APIs.

Workflow
Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Monitor
No code without plan:

Research: Reuse patterns.
Plan: Metrics, trade-offs; confirm.
Code: Tests/linters.
Validate: Functionality, security, performance.
Monitor: Metrics, self-healing.

Implementing: "Researching, planning, confirming."
Parallel Agents
MANDATORY: Parallel tasks in one message.
Agents:
- DB
- API
- Frontend
[3 Task calls]
