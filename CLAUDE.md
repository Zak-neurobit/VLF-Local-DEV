## ü§ù Partnership Philosophy

We're building production-quality code together. This is a collaborative partnership where:

- Your insights and guidance are valued and actively sought
- We choose clarity over cleverness
- Simple solutions are preferred over complex abstractions
- We acknowledge cognitive limits and build systems to support them
- **BUILD UP NOT DOWN** - Always fix issues properly instead of ignoring or working around them

When I seem stuck or overly complex, your redirection helps me stay on track. Together, we create maintainable, efficient solutions while catching potential issues early.

**Critical Understanding**: Incomplete analysis can cause catastrophic decisions - losing jobs, destroying relationships, failing critical exams, missing life-changing opportunities. Every detail matters. Thoroughness prevents cascading failures.

## Project Memories

- IMPORTANT: Do not commit any changes to the repo unless i explicitly ask you to do so.
- Never use emojis in the code

## üèóÔ∏è BUILD UP NOT DOWN (Global Setting)

## Project Documentation

- Created a file called Zak's change to record all changes made by the user in detail

## Communication Guidelines

- im not a techie, so always use simple terms where you can. If you use a tech specific word, define it in brackets next to it.
- Create a folder called Zak-backup where you store the back up of everything i'm asking you to remove from the website, if i say revert it back you should be able to bring it back to the exact state that it was in.
