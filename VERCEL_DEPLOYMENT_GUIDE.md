# Vercel Deployment Guide - Vasquez Law Firm

## 🔍 Where to Find Your Deployment

### 1. **Vercel Dashboard**

Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard

Look for your project:

- Project name: `vasquez-law-website` or `vlf-website`
- Check the deployment history tab

### 2. **Common Deployment URLs**

Your site could be at one of these URLs:

- `https://vasquez-law-website.vercel.app`
- `https://vlf-website.vercel.app`
- `https://[your-username]-vasquez-law-website.vercel.app`
- Custom domain if configured

## ⚠️ Why Your Build Might Look Outdated

### Issue 1: **Wrong Repository/Branch**

The deployment might be using an old commit from GitHub.

**Fix:**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Git
2. Ensure it's connected to: `https://github.com/quez2777/VLF-Website`
3. Check that it's deploying from the `main` branch
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest commit

### Issue 2: **Build Cache**

Vercel might be using cached dependencies or build artifacts.

**Fix:**

```bash
# From the fresh repository directory
cd /Users/williamvasquez/Documents/VLF-Website-fresh

# Force a fresh deployment without cache
npx vercel --prod --force
```

### Issue 3: **Environment Variables Missing**

Without proper env vars, features won't work properly.

**Fix:**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add all required variables from `.env.example`
3. Redeploy after adding variables

### Issue 4: **Old Deployment Still Active**

You might be looking at an old deployment URL.

**Fix:**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Look for the deployment marked as "Production"
3. Click on it to get the current production URL
