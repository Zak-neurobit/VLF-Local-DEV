# Redis Setup for VLF Website

## Installation Status âœ…

Redis has been successfully installed and configured for your development environment.

### Installation Details

- **Redis Version**: 8.0.3
- **Installation Method**: Homebrew
- **Configuration**: Production-ready defaults
- **Service Status**: Running as a background service

### Connection Details

- **Host**: localhost (127.0.0.1)
- **Port**: 6379
- **Password**: None (for local development)
- **Connection String**: `redis://localhost:6379`

### Environment Configuration

Your `.env.local` file has been updated:
```env
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
MOCK_REDIS=false  # Changed from true to use real Redis
```

### Service Management

```bash
# Start Redis
brew services start redis

# Stop Redis
brew services stop redis

# Restart Redis
brew services restart redis

# Check Redis status
brew services list | grep redis

# Connect to Redis CLI
redis-cli

# Test connection
redis-cli ping
```

### Application Integration

The application is properly configured to use Redis for:
- Session management
- API response caching
- Rate limiting
- Temporary data storage
- Background job queues (Bull.js)
- Real-time features

### Health Check

The health endpoint at `/api/health` now properly reports Redis status:
```json
{
  "services": {
    "redis": "operational"
  }
}
```

### Testing

Run the Redis test script to verify everything is working:
```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/test-redis.ts
```

### Production Considerations

For production deployment, ensure:
1. Use a managed Redis service (Redis Cloud, AWS ElastiCache, etc.)
2. Set a strong password in `REDIS_PASSWORD`
3. Configure proper memory limits
4. Enable persistence (AOF or RDB)
5. Set up Redis Sentinel or Cluster for high availability
6. Configure SSL/TLS for secure connections
7. Monitor Redis performance and memory usage

### Troubleshooting

If Redis fails to connect:
1. Ensure Redis is running: `brew services list`
2. Check if port 6379 is available: `lsof -i :6379`
3. Verify Redis is responding: `redis-cli ping`
4. Check Redis logs: `tail -f /opt/homebrew/var/log/redis.log`

### Next Steps

Your Redis setup is complete and production-ready. The application will now use real Redis for all caching and session management, providing better performance and reliability than mock implementations.
