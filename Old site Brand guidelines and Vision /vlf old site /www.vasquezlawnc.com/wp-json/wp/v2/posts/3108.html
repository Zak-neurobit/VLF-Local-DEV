You are very likely in a state of shock, and you might not know how best to help yourself. Many people don\u2019t realize that the actions they take immediately after an accident can affect their ability to recover compensation for their injuries later on!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawyers of Vasquez Law Firm understand the playbook for acquiring personal injury compensation. Understanding the common legal mistakes to avoid after a car accident can help ensure that you protect your rights and increase your chances of a successful personal injury claim.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this blog, we\u2019ll discuss some of the most common legal mistakes people make after a car accident and how to avoid them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Failing to Seek Medical Attention<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most common legal mistakes to avoid after a car accident is not seeking medical attention right away. Even if you feel fine or believe your injuries are minor, it\u2019s essential to get a medical evaluation as soon as possible. Many injuries, such as whiplash or internal damage, may not show symptoms immediately but can worsen over time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failing to seek medical care can hurt your personal injury claim because the insurance company may argue that your injuries weren\u2019t serious or were caused by something other than the accident. To protect yourself, always seek medical attention following a car accident and keep detailed records of your diagnosis and treatment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Not Calling the Police<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another critical legal mistake to avoid after a car accident is failing to call the police to the scene. In North Carolina, you\u2019re required to report an accident to law enforcement if it results in injury, death, or significant property damage. Even in minor accidents, having an official police report can be valuable evidence when filing an insurance claim.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The police report will document important details, such as the time and location of the accident, statements from the drivers and witnesses, and whether any traffic violations occurred. Without this report, it may be your word against the other driver\u2019s, making it more challenging to prove liability.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Admitting Fault<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the aftermath of an accident, it\u2019s natural to feel shaken and confused, but one of the biggest legal mistakes to avoid after a car accident is admitting fault or apologizing for the crash. Even if you think you may be partially responsible, avoid making any statements that could be interpreted as admitting guilt.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insurance companies will often use these statements to reduce or deny your claim. Instead of discussing fault, stick to the facts when speaking to law enforcement or insurance representatives. Let your attorney handle any discussions regarding liability.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Not Collecting Evidence at the Scene<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Failing to gather evidence at the scene of the accident is another common legal mistake to avoid after a car accident. While the police will gather some information, it\u2019s crucial that you collect your own evidence to support your case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take the following steps to gather essential evidence at the scene:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Photographs<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Take pictures of the vehicles, road conditions, traffic signs, and any visible injuries.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<p><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Contact Information<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Get the names, phone numbers, and insurance details of the other driver(s) involved in the accident.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<p><\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Witnesses<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Speak to any witnesses who saw the accident happen and ask for their contact information.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This evidence can be invaluable when filing an insurance claim or pursuing a personal injury lawsuit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. Waiting Too Long to File a Claim<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a car accident, it\u2019s essential to act quickly in filing your insurance claim or lawsuit. One of the most common legal mistakes to avoid after a car accident is waiting too long to initiate the claims process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In North Carolina, the <\/span><a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_1/gs_1-52.html/index.html><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statute of limitations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for personal injury claims is generally three years from the date of the accident. If you wait longer than this, you may lose your right to pursue compensation. However, it\u2019s best to start the process much earlier, as waiting too long can weaken your case. Witnesses\u2019 memories may fade, and evidence may be harder to gather as time passes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>6. Speaking to the Insurance Company Without Legal Representation<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people make the mistake of speaking to the at-fault driver\u2019s insurance company without first <\/span><a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.vasquezlawnc.com/north-carolina-attorney/6-reasons-why-you-should-hire-a-personal-injury-lawyer/index.html><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consulting a lawyer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is one of the most significant legal mistakes to avoid after a car accident, as insurance companies often try to minimize payouts by using your statements against you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insurance adjusters may ask leading questions or request a recorded statement, which could be used to diminish your claim. Before speaking with the insurance company, it\u2019s important to consult with a personal injury attorney who can guide you through the process and handle communication on your behalf.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>7. Accepting a Quick Settlement Offer<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insurance companies may offer you a settlement shortly after the accident, especially if liability is clear. While it may be tempting to accept the money and move on, this is often a legal mistake to avoid after a car accident.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first settlement offer is typically much lower than what you deserve. Accepting it can prevent you from seeking additional compensation later, even if your medical bills and other expenses continue to rise. Always consult with a lawyer before accepting any settlement offers to ensure that you\u2019re getting a fair deal.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>8. Failing to Keep Detailed Records<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A crucial step in protecting your rights after a car accident is keeping detailed records of everything related to the accident and your injuries. Failing to do so is a common legal mistake to avoid after a car accident.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep track of the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medical bills and records<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repair estimates for your vehicle<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lost wages due to time off work<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Correspondence with insurance companies<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These records will be critical in building a strong case and ensuring that you receive the compensation you deserve.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>9. Not Hiring an Experienced Personal Injury Lawyer<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most significant legal mistake to avoid after a car accident is not hiring an experienced personal injury lawyer to represent you. Car accident cases can be complicated, and having a knowledgeable attorney by your side can make a substantial difference in the outcome of your case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An experienced lawyer will:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investigate the accident thoroughly<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Negotiate with insurance companies on your behalf<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Help you gather evidence and expert testimony<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Advise you on when to settle or pursue litigation<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without legal representation, you risk accepting less compensation than you\u2019re entitled to or facing unnecessary delays in your case.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>10. Underestimating the Long-Term Impact of Injuries<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, one of the common legal mistakes to avoid after a car accident is underestimating the long-term impact of your injuries. Some injuries may require ongoing medical treatment or lead to permanent disability, affecting your ability to work and enjoy life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before accepting any settlement, make sure you fully understand the extent of your injuries and how they will impact you in the future. Your attorney can help you calculate the long-term costs associated with your injuries, including medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC Can Be Your Champion<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we understand how overwhelming it can be to navigate the aftermath of a car accident.
