For immigrants from Venezuela who are currently in the U.S., it is important to understand the legal options available to them. Immigrants may need to determine their options for\u00a0<a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.vasquezlawnc.com/immigration/deportation-removal-defense/index.html>defending against deportation<\/a>, as well as the steps they can take to maintain a legal status in the United States and receive work authorization. An\u00a0<a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.vasquezlawnc.com/index.html>attorney<\/a>\u00a0with experience in\u00a0<a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.vasquezlawnc.com/immigration/index.html>immigration<\/a>\u00a0law can provide guidance to Venezuelans, helping them understand how they can address the legal issues that may affect their immigration status.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The End of Deferred Enforced Departure (DED)<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) is a temporary status granted by executive action that allows immigrants from certain designated countries to remain in the United States temporarily without fear of deportation. In 2021, President Donald Trump issued a\u00a0<a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.vasquezlawnc.com/immigration/venezuelan-deferred-enforced-deportation-by-trump/index.html>memo granting DED to certain Venezuelan immigrants<\/a>. However, this DED status expired on July 20, 2022.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The Resumption of Deportations<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even after the expiration of DED, the United States did not perform deportations for Venezuelan immigrants due to diplomatic tensions between Venezuela and the U.S. Because deportation flights to Venezuela were unavailable, many Venezuelan immigrants had been detained but had not been removed from the United States.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Conditions have begun to change in Venezuela, and the United States is beginning to resume diplomatic ties. The United States has also faced an influx of Venezuelans who have crossed the southern border illegally, with nearly 500,000 migrants entering the U.S. within the past three years. Because of these issues,\u00a0<a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2023/10/18/ice-migrants-venezuela-repatriation/index.html>deportation flights have been resumed for Venezuelan immigrants<\/a>. The administration of President Joe Biden began deporting immigrants to Venezuela in October of 2023.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Temporary Protected Status and Other Options for Venezuelan Immigrants<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While Venezuelan immigrants may be at risk of deportation, they also have options for entering the U.S. legally or receiving authorization to remain in the country. Currently, the United States is accepting 30,000 immigrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Haiti each month, and it will also grant\u00a0<a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.vasquezlawnc.com/immigration/asylum-refugee-legal-help/index.html>asylum<\/a>\u00a0to 45,000 immigrants who take the proper steps to make appointments with immigration officials before crossing the border.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Certain Venezuelans may also be eligible for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which will provide protection against deportation for a certain period of time. Venezuela has previously been designated with Temporary Protected Status, and this\u00a0<a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/temporary-protected-status/temporary-protected-status-designated-country-venezuela/index.html>designation was extended<\/a>\u00a0for 18 months in September of 2023. Venezuelan immigrants who entered the United States before July 31, 2023 and have remained in the country continuously since that date may apply for TPS, which will protect them against deportation until April 2, 2025.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Contact Our Raleigh Immigration Lawyers for Venezuelan Migrants<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are an immigrant from Venezuela who needs to make sure you can remain in the United States, or if you are seeking to help a family member immigrate to the U.S. from Venezuela, Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC can provide you with legal help and representation.
