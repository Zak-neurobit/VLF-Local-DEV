These policies pay<a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/files.nc.gov/ncoshr/documents/files/Workers-Comp-Employee-Handbook-2018-11-28.pdf/index.html>\u00a0specific benefits<\/a>\u00a0to workers who become ill or injured on the job, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Medical expenses<\/li>\n<li>A portion of lost wages<\/li>\n<li>Temporary or permanent disability benefits<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If an employee dies because of a work-related injury or illness, eligible survivors can receive<a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute/97-38.htm/index.html>\u00a0workers\u2019 comp death benefits<\/a>. When workers or their families accept workers\u2019 comp benefits, they usually enter a tacit agreement not to pursue personal injury or wrongful death claims against the employer. However, depending on the circumstances, you may qualify for compensation paid by third parties. Your legal team from Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC can handle all eligible claims.<\/p>\n<h2>How Do You Know Who Should Pay?<\/h2>\n<p>Accidents can happen in any workplace, from office settings and warehouse operations to retail stores and land excavation. Injuries range from repetitive motion injuries and broken bones to spinal cord damage, brain injuries, and fatalities.<\/p>\n<p>Although workers do not have to prove fault to receive workers\u2019 comp benefits, establishing why an accident happened may give grounds for additional compensation through a personal injury or wrongful death claim. Examples of third-party liability include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Manufacturers<\/strong>\u00a0may be liable for defective parts or equipment.<\/li>\n<li>Although you may work for a company contracted to perform work,\u00a0<strong>landowners<\/strong>\u00a0might be liable for injuries due to work done on their property.<\/li>\n<li>If your job duties involve driving,\u00a0<strong>another motorist<\/strong>\u00a0could be at fault for a motor vehicle collision that injures you.<\/li>\n<li>If several crews working for multiple companies are on a job site simultaneously,\u00a0<strong>another company<\/strong>\u00a0may be liable.<\/li>\n<li>If a delivery company employee injures you in your office, the\u00a0<strong>employee and his employer<\/strong>\u00a0might be at fault.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is impossible to determine whether you can file additional claims and who should pay until your attorney from Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC investigates the circumstances surrounding your workplace injury or your loved one\u2019s death. However, we will help you pursue all available means of getting compensation.<\/p>\n<h2>Contact Our Dedicated Raleigh, NC Workers\u2019 Compensation Lawyers Today<\/h2>\n<p>If you have questions or need assistance with your own workers\u2019 comp claim or a family member\u2019s, you can count on Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC to protect your best interests.
