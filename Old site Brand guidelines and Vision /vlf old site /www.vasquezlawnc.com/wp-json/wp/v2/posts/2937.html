Some of the most common include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Heat: Since farm workers generally work outside regardless of the season, they can be exposed to strong sunlight and high temperatures. As a result, farm workers can suffer from severe sunburns and other sun-related skin conditions, dehydration, and heat stroke.<\/li>\n<li>Chemicals: Certain chemicals such as herbicides or pesticides that are often used when working with crops can be harmful to someone who comes into contact with them, whether through inhalation, or contact with the skin, eyes, or mouth.<\/li>\n<li>Overexertion: Farm work is physically demanding, with workers often needing to handle heavy machinery or heavy animals. The constant bending, heavy lifting, and strain can lead to joint, tissue, muscle, or bone injuries.<\/li>\n<li>Equipment malfunctions: As mentioned above, farm workers often handle heavy machinery like plows, combines, and tractors. Whether they are operating in the fields or transporting something on roads,\u00a0<a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.vasquezlawnc.com/workers-compensation-job-injury/equipment-accidents-failures/index.html>equipment malfunctions<\/a>\u00a0could cause serious accidents resulting in severe injury.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Workers\u2019 Compensation for Farm Workers<\/h2>\n<p>Like many other industries, farm workers are often eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits if they are injured while doing their job. Such benefits can cover medical expenses related to their injuries as well as some of their lost wages.However, many farm workers are temporary or contract-based employees who are not always eligible for the same coverage. In such cases, there are other options available. For example, they could bring a personal injury claim against their employer or a third party that was involved. To do so, they would need to demonstrate that their injury was caused by someone else\u2019s negligence or actions.<\/p>\n<h2>Schedule a Free Consultation with a Wake County, NC Workers\u2019 Compensation Lawyer<\/h2>\n<p>If you are a farm worker who got hurt on the job, speak with a qualified\u00a0<a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.vasquezlawnc.com/contact/index.html>Raleigh, NC work injury attorney<\/a>\u00a0to understand your options.
