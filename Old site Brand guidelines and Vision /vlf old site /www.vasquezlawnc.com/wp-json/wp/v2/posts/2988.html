However, studies suggest as many as one in four people have driven under the influence of alcohol or other substances. Some DWI arrests are the result of a poor decision while other times, faulty breath testing devices or other issues lead to an unjustified DWI arrest.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you were charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI), you may also be very nervous about the consequences you face for your actions. While this is natural, it is also important to know that the legal consequences for something like a DWI are rarely set in stone. The advocacy of a great attorney can help you fight the charges and possibly even get them dropped.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 800;\">What Can an Attorney Do in My Defense?<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the facts of the case, an attorney has several options available for fighting the charges. These include, but are not limited to:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<li>Questioning the validity of a breathalyzer result<\/li>\n<li>Questioning the validity of the roadside test (if the officer asked you to walk in a straight line, count backward from 100, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Questioning the officer\u2019s justification for pulling you over in the first place<\/li>\n<li>Questioning the chain of custody of any evidence<\/li>\n<li>Arguing that you are a first-time offender with no criminal history<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using one or more of these strategies could result in the following actions:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<li>Convincing the prosecutor not to file charges, or to drop charges if already filed<\/li>\n<li>Reducing the charges you face<\/li>\n<li>Negotiating a plea deal that allows you to stay out of jail or not go to trial<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to note that no outcome can be definitively guaranteed, but your prospects of avoiding harsh punishment are much higher with the help of an experienced attorney who knows local judges and prosecutors.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, many prosecutors are willing to enter into plea deals for DWI cases, especially for first-time offenders. In exchange for a guilty plea and\/or the promise to attend substance abuse counseling, you may receive a greatly reduced sentence or charge dropped from a DWI to a reckless driving. This may allow you to keep your driver\u2019s license, pay lower fees, or avoid jail time.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 800;\">Contact a Raleigh, NC DWI Defense Lawyer<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facing charges of a DWI can be scary, but having a tough, experienced\u00a0<a style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600;\" href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.vasquezlawnc.com/contact/index.html>Wake County DWI attorney<\/a>\u00a0can help you get the charges reduced or dropped altogether.
