Applying makeup or using any grooming tools while on the road is dangerous.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure pets are secured.<\/li>\n<li>If you\u2019re someone who is easily distracted by conversation or the presence of others, consider limiting the amount of people you let into your vehicle.<\/li>\n<li>Should there be anything that requires your immediate attention while driving, a child, a pet, or emergency phone call, be sure to pull off to a safe spot and park before diverting your attention.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Speeding<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Speeding is another common cause of auto accidents that can have serious consequences.

It is illegal across the United States to drive with a BAC (blood alcohol concentration) of .08 or higher, however, even the smallest bit of alcohol can impair one\u2019s driving abilities. When someone drives drunk, they can not only injure themselves, but others as well. Not to mention the legal repercussions that can ensue, like being arrested, fined, and having your license suspended.
