However, there are clear steps you can take to fight for the benefits you deserve.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lawyers of Vasquez Law Firm have been helping our clients for over 35 years access the compensation they need to heal after workplace injuries.

Read on to discover the right moves for your health and financial recovery.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Common Reasons For A Denied Workers\u2019 Comp Claim<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before diving into the steps you should take after a denial, it\u2019s essential to understand why your workers\u2019 comp claim might have been denied in the first place. Here are some common reasons:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Insufficient Medical Evidence<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The insurance company may argue that your medical records don\u2019t prove that your injury is work-related or severe enough to warrant compensation.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Failure To Report The Injury Promptly<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: In North Carolina, employees must report their injuries within 30 days. Missing this deadline can result in a denied workers\u2019 comp claim.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Disputed Work-Related Injury<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If the employer or insurance company believes your injury didn\u2019t occur at work or wasn\u2019t caused by work-related duties, they may deny your claim.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Missed Filing Deadlines<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: North Carolina law requires workers to file a claim with the <\/span><a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.ic.nc.gov/index.html><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">North Carolina Industrial Commission (NCIC)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> within two years of the injury. Missing this deadline can lead to a denial.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Steps To Take After A Denied Workers\u2019 Comp Claim<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve received a denial letter, don\u2019t panic. You have the right to appeal the decision and present evidence to support your claim. Here are the steps you should take:<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>1. Understand The Reason For Denial<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step is to carefully read the denial letter. The letter should outline the specific reason or reasons your workers\u2019 comp claim was denied. Understanding this reason will help you and your attorney build a strong case for appeal.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>2. Consult An Experienced Workers\u2019 Comp Attorney<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Navigating a denied workers\u2019 comp claim can be challenging, especially if you\u2019re dealing with an insurance company that is more interested in protecting its bottom line than providing the benefits you deserve. Consulting with an experienced workers\u2019 comp attorney in North Carolina can make a significant difference. They can help you understand the denial, gather evidence, and represent you during the appeals process.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>3. File A Form 33 Request For Hearing<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you believe the denial was unjustified, you can request a hearing with the North Carolina Industrial Commission (NCIC). To do this, you must file a <\/span><a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.ic.nc.gov/forms/form33.pdf/index.html><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form 33<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, also known as a \u201cRequest for Hearing.\u201d This form officially initiates the appeal process and provides you with an opportunity to present your case to a <\/span><a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.ic.nc.gov/depcomm.html/index.html><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deputy Commissioner<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In North Carolina, you must file a Form 33 within two years of the date of your injury or the date of your last workers\u2019 comp payment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>4. Gather Strong Medical Evidence<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the main reasons for a denied workers\u2019 comp claim is insufficient medical evidence. If you\u2019re facing this issue, you\u2019ll need to <\/span><a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.vasquezlawnc.com/documents-you-need-for-your-workers-comp-claim/index.html><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">gather additional evidence<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to support your case. This can include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Medical Records<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Obtain copies of all medical records related to your injury, including doctor\u2019s notes, diagnostic tests, and treatment plans.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Second Medical Opinion<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Consider seeking a second opinion from a qualified healthcare provider who can thoroughly evaluate your condition and provide an objective assessment.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Expert Testimony<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: In some cases, your attorney may recommend securing expert testimony to help explain the connection between your work and your injury.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>5. Prepare For Mediation<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before your case goes to a formal hearing, the NCIC may require mediation. Mediation is an opportunity for you, your employer, and the insurance company to discuss the case and potentially reach a settlement. It\u2019s essential to enter mediation prepared and with clear documentation supporting your claim. Your attorney will guide you through mediation, helping you understand the options and negotiate a fair settlement.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>6. Attend The Hearing<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If mediation doesn\u2019t result in a resolution, your case will proceed to a formal hearing before a Deputy Commissioner. During the hearing, you and your attorney will present evidence to support your claim, including medical records, witness testimonies, and expert opinions. The employer and insurance company will also present their case. Your attorney will be responsible for presenting the evidence and arguing your case. They will aim to demonstrate that your injury is work-related and that you are entitled to benefits.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>7. Appeal The Deputy Commissioner\u2019s Decision (If Necessary)<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Deputy Commissioner rules against you, it\u2019s not the end of the road. You have the right to appeal their decision to the Full Commission. During this process, the Full Commission will review the evidence and the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s decision to determine if an error was made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the Full Commission\u2019s decision is still not in your favor, you can appeal to the North Carolina Court of Appeals. However, it\u2019s essential to discuss this option with your attorney to understand the likelihood of success.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Tips For Improving Your Chances Of A Successful Appeal<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appealing a denied workers\u2019 comp claim can be a complex process, but there are steps you can take to improve your chances of success:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Keep Detailed Records<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Maintain thorough records of your injury, medical treatment, and communications with your employer and the insurance company.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Follow Your Doctor\u2019s Orders<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Adhering to your doctor\u2019s treatment plan is critical to demonstrating that you are actively working towards recovery.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Be Honest And Consistent<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When speaking with medical professionals, your employer, and your attorney, be honest and consistent in describing your injury and how it occurred.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Consult With An Attorney Early<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The earlier you consult with an attorney, the better they can help you build a strong case and avoid potential pitfalls.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>Vasquez Law Firm Can Be Your Legal Advocate<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Vasquez Law Firm in North Carolina, we have a proven track record of helping our clients access the funds that are due to them.
