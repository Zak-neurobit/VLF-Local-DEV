Whether you are a construction worker or a secretary in an office, you might suffer an injury while on the job. No matter what field in which you are injured, you will be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation\u2013 however, making a claim is not always as easy as it seems or should be. If you are injured at your workplace, you need to be prepared and organized in order to claim the full amount which you are owed in order to treat your injuries and make a full recovery!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we have worked diligently over the years to ensure that workers\u2019 rights are protected and our clients are able to overcome frustrating barriers to accessing the full amount of compensation that they are owed. We understand that preparation through accurate documentation is key when it comes to legal procedures.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have compiled this blog to help those who are going through the process of claiming workers\u2019 comp know the documents they should have on hand, particularly if they are concerned that their employer or insurance company might try to cheat them out of their full damages. Read on to discover how you can best optimize your claim.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Why Do I Need Documentation For My Injuries?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an ideal world, people injured on their worksite would be given compensation for their injuries that is not only timely, but of the correct amount each and every time. Unfortunately, the world of workers\u2019 comp is not quite so ideal, which leads to complications. Sometimes, workers\u2019 comp claims are purposefully shortchanged because of employers or insurance companies looking to protect their bottom lines rather than protect the wellbeing of workers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a workers\u2019 comp claim, being able to provide thorough documentation can mean that court cases go smoothly and you are not cheated out of any money that you are owed. Having proper documentation can also mean that there is no guesswork involved with your claim as everything is laid down as it should be in hard data. In order to avoid any unnecessary confusion, it is best if you have these documents compiled in a safe place either for your reference or to corroborate any part of your claim.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>First Report Of Injury<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are first making a worker\u2019s comp claim, you will need to submit your <\/span><a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.myfloridacfo.com/docs-sf/risk-management-libraries/risk-documents/02-dfs-f2-dwc-1-fnoi_rev3-2009.pdf%EF%B9%96sfvrsn=efe102e3_12%EA%A4%B7.html><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First Report Of Injury<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to your employer. In order to be viable, this report should be filed within ten days of experiencing your injury. Provide as much detail related to the injury as you possibly can. Make a copy of these forms for your personal records. If you are able, you can also document the circumstances of your injury in other ways\u2013for example, if you can get eyewitness statements from coworkers that corroborate your version of events, it can be helpful to have that sort of documentation as part of your claims package.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Medical Reports<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to determine how much compensation you should pursue for your worker\u2019s comp claim, medical reports will stand as testament to what you are owed. Collect as much documentation as you can related to your medical diagnoses, including any doctor\u2019s notes. The details of your medical records, as well as any necessary testimony from your care providers, are pivotal to determine the amount of money that you need, as well as how much time you will need to recover sufficiently to return to work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, you might want to get ahold of your past medical records <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">related to your injury. In some cases, you might be challenged on the recency of the injury or subject to accusations that you are seeking compensation for an old affliction that was accrued outside of the workplace. If you can provide your past medical records, you can prove that the workplace injury is, indeed, recent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Employment And Wage Records<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One essential part of workers\u2019 comp that gets overlooked is the cost of lost wages. Obviously workers\u2019 comp exists to compensate for injuries that have occurred because of working conditions, but the other side of workers\u2019 comp is to make sure that employees are not losing out on wages because of recovery time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are not able to come back to work for any period of time following your injury, workers\u2019 comp should cover you for those lost wages. Document the days that you were not able to work and the amount of money that you lost out on. If you are on a tipped wage, calculate the average amount that you would have earned per shift that you missed. Documentation such as your pay stubs can be testamentary to how much you should be compensated in terms of lost wages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Police Report<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If emergency authorities were contacted as a result of the circumstances that caused your workplace injury, the filed police report can help corroborate your version of events. If it comes down to litigation in order to get the full amount you are owed, the police report of the incident can serve as evidence that workplace conditions were unsafe or that you suffered the injuries that you claim.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Insurance Information<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your employers\u2019 insurance claim is an important piece in the overall workers\u2019 comp puzzle. With this information, you can ensure that everything is filed correctly and that there are no issues that should impede your claim.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Emails, Texts, And Other Relevant Communications<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any written communication involving your injury can back up the circumstances of its occurrence. Not only can written testimony help prove your version of events, it can act as evidence that you followed procedure for reporting the incident and making your claim.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC Can Get You The Workers\u2019 Comp You Deserve<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Vasquez Law, PLLC, we have over 40 years of experience pursuing damages for clients and getting them the settlements that they deserve.
