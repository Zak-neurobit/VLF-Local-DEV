With so much time on the clock, work injuries are bound to happen. While some of these injuries may be so minor that they do not justify taking any kind of legal action, others can be serious enough that they put someone out of work permanently. North Carolina requires most businesses to have\u00a0<a style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600;\" href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.vasquezlawnc.com/workers-compensation-job-injury/index.html>workers\u2019 compensation insurance<\/a>, but that does not necessarily mean your employer has workers\u2019 compensation insurance or, if it does, that the insurance will cover your injury. To learn what kind of injuries workers\u2019 compensation is meant to cover, read on and then contact a North Carolina workers\u2019 compensation insurance attorney for more information.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 800;\">Which Employers Need to Have Workers\u2019 Compensation in North Carolina?<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">North Carolina law requires businesses with three or more employees to have either workers\u2019 compensation insurance or to qualify as a self-insured employer. However, certain employees are exempt from workers\u2019 compensation coverage, including:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<li>\u201cCasual\u201d employees (people who can come and go from a job site at will)<\/li>\n<li>Most contract workers (although many contract workers could still be classified as employees in the case of a workplace injury)<\/li>\n<li>Domestic employees<\/li>\n<li>Agricultural workers, when there are fewer than ten employees<\/li>\n<li>Railroad employees<\/li>\n<li>Federal government employees<\/li>\n<li>Corporate officers who want to be excluded from coverage<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While having workers\u2019 compensation insurance is mandatory for most employers, not all employers follow the law, leaving both themselves and their employees vulnerable.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 800;\">Which Injuries Are Covered Under Workers\u2019 Compensation?<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a worker is covered by worker\u2019s compensation, the injured worker gives up his or her right to sue the employer in the event of a workplace injury. However, the worker may be able to sue a third party if that party\u2019s negligence caused the injury. One of the main benefits of worker\u2019s compensation is that it is not dependent on fault. This means that even if an employee was responsible for his own injury, workers\u2019 compensation usually still covers him. Workers\u2019 compensation can provide payment for more than just treatment for injuries; it can also include:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<li>Missed wages<\/li>\n<li>Funeral costs<\/li>\n<li>Therapy and rehabilitative care<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: 800;\">Call a Smithfield, NC Workers\u2019 Compensation Lawyer<\/h3>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you were injured at work and have questions about how North Carolina\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws apply to your case, contact a\u00a0<a style=\"font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600;\" href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.vasquezlawnc.com/contact/index.html>Johnston County, NC workers\u2019 compensation attorney<\/a>\u00a0with Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC.
