Our Raleigh workers\u2019 comp lawyers have represented clients with injuries that were sustained in all kinds of spaces, including offices. Some of the types of workers\u2019 comp injuries we represent at Vasquez Law Firm include, but are not limited to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Overexertion and heavy lifting:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Injuries related to overexertion and heavy lifting account for most of the workplace injuries suffered by Americans, according to OSHA. Most of these injuries occur as a result of unsafe practices such as attempting to lift too much weight at once, lifting from an awkward position, and repetitive motions of lifting or carrying.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Repetitive motion:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When workers are required to perform repetitive tasks no matter how small, the repetition can cause strain that over time leads to injuries. Some common conditions that can result from repetitive motion tasks are carpal tunnel syndrome, knee injuries, shoulder and rotator cuff injuries, tendonitis, herniated discs, stress fractures, and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Equipment:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When heavy equipment is involved, operators are at risk of injury or even fatality. Industrial laborers are exposed to risks from equipment that can malfunction, toxic chemicals, electric shock, and machinery that has been worn down over time.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Construction site:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Construction sites are by their nature dangerous, and there are countless ways that injuries can occur on these sites. Everything from electrical shock and explosion to faulty equipment and vehicle accidents could be a reason someone is injured on a construction site.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Mental health:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Not many people think of depression and anxiety as a workers\u2019 comp issue, but when you are injured on the job and you suffer a blow to your mental health because of anxiety surrounding the job that injured you or depression due to your injuries, workers\u2019 compensation can also be used to pay for your mental healthcare.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are a few of the more common workplace injury possibilities, but they are not the only injuries that occur in the workplace. If you have sustained an injury on the job, we want to hear from you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Why Do I Need A Workers\u2019 Comp Lawyer If I\u2019ve Been Injured?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though you may be entitled to compensation, working with insurance can be tricky. Insurance companies are worried about their bottom line at the end of the day, and employers can be reluctant to cooperate. Even if you are offered some compensation for your injury, it might not be enough to cover your medical bills and the wages that you lost when you were not able to go to work. At Vasquez Law Group, we believe in fighting for what you are owed until it is paid to you in full.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Trust Our Raleigh Workers\u2019 Comp Lawyers To Seek Justice For You<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With over 35 years of combined experience, Vasquez Law Group knows what it means to fight for workers\u2019 comp.

The federal laws that apply to family-based immigration can be complex and confusing, and it can be challenging to understand and meet the law's requirements. This is why it is so important to work closely with a qualified family-based immigration attorney as you seek to offer a better life and new opportunities to your loved ones. We have the experience, knowledge, and resources to help you obtain the necessary visas for your family members in a variety of circumstances or situations.<\/p><p>The skilled attorneys at our firm have over 35 years of combined experience in handling family-related immigration matters. We know how to anticipate and address potential issues in advance so that they do not become serious obstacles. Our team is dedicated to helping you secure a favorable result for your family member, no matter the challenges that may arise.<\/p><h3>Immigration Counsel for Families in North Carolina<\/h3><p>The area of family-based immigration encompasses a wide range of cases in which United States citizens and lawful permanent residents (\"<a href=../../../../%22/immigration/green-cards/index.html>green card<\/a>\" holders) seek to bring their family members and future spouses to the U.S. legally. According to U.S. immigration law, lawful permanent residents and legal citizens can serve as sponsors to help their relatives obtain <a href=../../../../%22/immigration/family-visa-types/index.html>permanent or temporary visas<\/a>. <\/p><p>Generally, the application process for family-based immigration is relatively straightforward. The process begins when a citizen or permanent resident files a completed Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) with the primary immigration agency of the U.S. government: United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, also known as USCIS. Once the petition is accepted by USCIS, the petitioner will be notified of a date after which the family members in question are able to apply for visas or green cards. <\/p><h3>Johnson County Lawyers Who Understand the Preference System for Family-Based Immigration<\/h3><p>The United States government allows for the approval of a limited number of family visas and permanent resident status applications in a given year. Therefore, a preference system has been created for processing family immigration requests. Legal spouses, minor children, and parents of current U.S. citizens over the age of 21 are <a href=../../../../%22/immigration/immediate-relative-visas/index.html>immediate relatives<\/a>, which means they are not included in the family preference system. <\/p><p>Applications for other relatives, however, are considered in order based on the status of the petitioner and the relationship:<\/p><ul><li>First preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their unmarried children over the age of 21.<\/li><li>Second preference is given to petitions filed by permanent residents for their spouses and children. Minor children receive preference over adult children. <\/li><li>Third preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their married children and the immediate relatives of their married children. <\/li><li>Fourth preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their siblings and the immediate relatives of their siblings. <\/li><\/ul><p>A family-based immigration petition will not be considered for grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, or in-laws.<\/p><h3>Smithfield Lawyers for Fianc\u00e9 Visas<\/h3><p>If you are a U.S. citizen or green card holder and you are engaged to a foreign national, it may be possible to obtain a K-visa to bring your fianc\u00e9 to the U.S. so that you can get married. A K-visa might also be helpful if you already married a foreign national abroad but your spouse has not received his or her green card yet. K-visas are commonly called \"<a href=../../../../%22/immigration/fiance-k-visas/index.html>fianc\u00e9 visas<\/a>,\" and they are not permanent. Your future spouse's K-visa can be revoked if you never finalize the marriage or if your marriage is dissolved through <a href=../../../../%22/family-law/divorce/index.html>divorce<\/a> or annulment. <\/p><h3>Work with a Knowledgeable North Carolina Immigration Lawyer<\/h3><p>Family-based immigration concerns can be complicated, and you may have several options for bringing your relatives or your fianc\u00e9 to the United States legally. At Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we will meet with you to discuss your situation and to determine the best way to meet your needs.
