A lot of people imagine that workers\u2019 comp is only relevant to places that do construction or factories or places that otherwise work with heavy equipment. While these types of jobs are more likely to incur workplace injuries, the truth is that accidents can happen anywhere and any workplace can be negligent!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To better understand how workplace injuries occur, here are some of the more common ones we have seen in our practice:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Overexertion and heavy lifting<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: In jobs that require a lot of manual labor, trying to lift heavy objects that are over your weight limit or lifting them incorrectly can result in injury. These types of workplace injuries are among the most common!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Repetitive motion injuries<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Even the simplest repetitive motions can cause strain and eventually lead to permanent injury. Even if you are working at a desk, repeating the same motion too many times can lead to issues like carpal tunnel. Even positioning your wrist incorrectly for long periods of time can have significant health implications over time!<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Equipment-related injuries<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There are many dangers inherent in workplaces that concern heavy machinery. Basic negligence can be a huge risk. Machines can malfunction for many reasons, including improper maintenance, poor design, chemical corrosion, and improper usage, all of which put associated workers in danger.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=../../../../%22https%EF%B9%95/www.vasquezlawnc.com/north-carolina-attorney/how-can-i-get-compensation-for-a-construction-site-injury-in-north-carolina/index.html><b>Construction site injuries<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Working at a construction site has many risks, including those associated with equipment-related injuries. If your machinery is defective or improperly maintained, you could be seriously injured. On construction sites, you also have to worry about danger from falls, explosions, and structural collapses.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Mental health impairment<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you have an injury covered by workers\u2019 comp, the associated mental stresses that you have undergone also deserve compensation! After being injured, it\u2019s common to experience depression, anxiety, or PTSD, and your workers\u2019 comp claim should address these issues in addition to your injuries.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>How Our Winston-Salem Workers\u2019 Comp Lawyers Can Make A Difference<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though legally you are entitled to workers\u2019 comp in the event of a workplace injury, employers and insurance companies might conspire to cheat you. They might find incidental reasons to deny your claim or pay you less than what you are owed, hoping that if you accept their initial payment, you can be refused for any additional payments later on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If companies want to choose their bottom line over the wellbeing of your employees, our Winston-Salem workers&#8217; comp lawyers can help fight back.

The federal laws that apply to family-based immigration can be complex and confusing, and it can be challenging to understand and meet the law's requirements. This is why it is so important to work closely with a qualified family-based immigration attorney as you seek to offer a better life and new opportunities to your loved ones. We have the experience, knowledge, and resources to help you obtain the necessary visas for your family members in a variety of circumstances or situations.<\/p><p>The skilled attorneys at our firm have over 35 years of combined experience in handling family-related immigration matters. We know how to anticipate and address potential issues in advance so that they do not become serious obstacles. Our team is dedicated to helping you secure a favorable result for your family member, no matter the challenges that may arise.<\/p><h3>Immigration Counsel for Families in North Carolina<\/h3><p>The area of family-based immigration encompasses a wide range of cases in which United States citizens and lawful permanent residents (\"<a href=../../../../%22/immigration/green-cards/index.html>green card<\/a>\" holders) seek to bring their family members and future spouses to the U.S. legally. According to U.S. immigration law, lawful permanent residents and legal citizens can serve as sponsors to help their relatives obtain <a href=../../../../%22/immigration/family-visa-types/index.html>permanent or temporary visas<\/a>. <\/p><p>Generally, the application process for family-based immigration is relatively straightforward. The process begins when a citizen or permanent resident files a completed Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) with the primary immigration agency of the U.S. government: United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, also known as USCIS. Once the petition is accepted by USCIS, the petitioner will be notified of a date after which the family members in question are able to apply for visas or green cards. <\/p><h3>Johnson County Lawyers Who Understand the Preference System for Family-Based Immigration<\/h3><p>The United States government allows for the approval of a limited number of family visas and permanent resident status applications in a given year. Therefore, a preference system has been created for processing family immigration requests. Legal spouses, minor children, and parents of current U.S. citizens over the age of 21 are <a href=../../../../%22/immigration/immediate-relative-visas/index.html>immediate relatives<\/a>, which means they are not included in the family preference system. <\/p><p>Applications for other relatives, however, are considered in order based on the status of the petitioner and the relationship:<\/p><ul><li>First preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their unmarried children over the age of 21.<\/li><li>Second preference is given to petitions filed by permanent residents for their spouses and children. Minor children receive preference over adult children. <\/li><li>Third preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their married children and the immediate relatives of their married children. <\/li><li>Fourth preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their siblings and the immediate relatives of their siblings. <\/li><\/ul><p>A family-based immigration petition will not be considered for grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, or in-laws.<\/p><h3>Smithfield Lawyers for Fianc\u00e9 Visas<\/h3><p>If you are a U.S. citizen or green card holder and you are engaged to a foreign national, it may be possible to obtain a K-visa to bring your fianc\u00e9 to the U.S. so that you can get married. A K-visa might also be helpful if you already married a foreign national abroad but your spouse has not received his or her green card yet. K-visas are commonly called \"<a href=../../../../%22/immigration/fiance-k-visas/index.html>fianc\u00e9 visas<\/a>,\" and they are not permanent. Your future spouse's K-visa can be revoked if you never finalize the marriage or if your marriage is dissolved through <a href=../../../../%22/family-law/divorce/index.html>divorce<\/a> or annulment. <\/p><h3>Work with a Knowledgeable North Carolina Immigration Lawyer<\/h3><p>Family-based immigration concerns can be complicated, and you may have several options for bringing your relatives or your fianc\u00e9 to the United States legally. At Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we will meet with you to discuss your situation and to determine the best way to meet your needs. We understand the challenges that you may be facing, and we are equipped to provide the guidance you need at every stage of the immigration process.<\/p><p>To learn more about our firm and how we can help you, <a href=../../../../%22/contact/index.html>contact our office<\/a>.
