Our team is dedicated to helping you secure a favorable result for your family member, no matter the challenges that may arise.<\/p>\n<h3>Immigration Counsel for Families in North Carolina<\/h3>\n<p>The area of family-based immigration encompasses a wide range of cases in which United States citizens and lawful permanent residents (\u201cgreen card\u201d holders) seek to bring their family members and future spouses to the U.S. legally. According to U.S. immigration law, lawful permanent residents and legal citizens can serve as sponsors to help their relatives obtain permanent or temporary visas.<br \/>\nThis process is critical for families affected by illegal immigration concerns or those looking to assist loved ones in avoiding legal complications.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, the application process for family-based immigration is relatively straightforward. The process begins when a citizen or permanent resident files a completed Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) with the primary immigration agency of the U.S. government: United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, also known as USCIS. Once the petition is accepted by USCIS, the petitioner will be notified of a date after which the family members in question can apply for visas or green cards.<\/p>\n<h3>Johnson County Lawyers Who Understand the Preference System for Family-Based Immigration<\/h3>\n<p>The United States government allows for approving a limited number of family visas and permanent resident status applications in a given year. Therefore, a preference system has been created for processing family immigration requests, even if you are hiring an immigration lawyer. Legal spouses, minor children, and parents of current U.S. citizens over 21 are immediate relatives, which means they are not included in the family preference system.<br \/>\nApplications for other relatives, however, are considered in order based on the status of the petitioner and the relationship:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their unmarried children over the age of 21.<\/li>\n<li>Second preference is given to petitions filed by permanent residents for their spouses and children. Minor children receive preference over adult children.<\/li>\n<li>Third, preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their married children and the immediate relatives of their married children.<\/li>\n<li>Fourth, preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their siblings and the immediate relatives of their siblings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Smithfield Lawyers for Fianc\u00e9 Visas<\/h3>\n<p>If you are a U.S. citizen or green card holder engaged to a foreign national, it may be possible to obtain a K-visa to bring your fianc\u00e9 to the U.S. so you can get married. A K-visa might also be helpful if you already married a foreign national abroad, but your spouse has not yet received his or her green card. K-visas are commonly called \u201cfianc\u00e9 visas,\u201d and they are not permanent. Your future spouse\u2019s K-visa can be revoked if you never finalize the marriage or if your marriage is dissolved through divorce or annulment. It&#8217;s important to consult with an experienced immigration lawyer to understand how immigration reform might affect this process.<\/p>\n<h3>Work with a Knowledgeable North Carolina Immigration Lawyer<\/h3>\n<p>New immigration law can be complicated, and you may have several options for legally bringing your relatives or your fianc\u00e9 to the United States.

While the topic of immigration is often highly politicized, the reality is that many thousands of foreign nationals come to the U.S. each year. Some of them only intend to stay temporarily while others arrive with the intention of building a new life for themselves and their loved ones. Unfortunately, U.S. immigration laws and the process of immigrating to the United States can be extremely complicated and confusing\u2014especially when language barriers exist. The good news is that our team is here to help.<\/p><p>At the <a href=../../../../%22/attorneys/index.html>Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC<\/a>, our skilled immigration lawyers have more than 35 years of combined legal experience. Our team has a vast working knowledge of U.S. immigration policies and practices, as well as a professional relationship with the federal agencies tasked with monitoring the immigration process. We work with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, commonly referred to as the Border Patrol. Our goal is to help you and your loved ones enjoy all of the benefits that life in the United States has to offer. <\/p><h3>Johnston County Immigration Lawyers Helping to Meet Your Needs<\/h3><p>If you are a foreign national who is looking to come to the U.S., you must decide if you intend to remain in the United States temporarily or on a permanent basis. If you are looking to bring a family member to the U.S., you will need to make the same determination for him or her as well. For those whose stay in the U.S. is meant to be temporary, such as students, tourists, and certain workers, a non-immigrant visa will usually meet their needs. If you intend to live and work in the United States permanently, you must apply for an immigrant visa. Once you have an immigrant visa, you can then seek lawful permanent resident status\u2014commonly known as a \"<a href=../../../../%22/immigration/green-cards/index.html>green card<\/a>\"\u2014and eventually, full <a href=../../../../%22/immigration/citizenship-naturalization/index.html>U.S. citizenship<\/a>. A non-immigrant can also obtain a green card by petitioning for an Adjustment of Status. <\/p><p>The U.S. government makes immigrant <a href=../../../../%22/immigration/family-visa-types/index.html>visas<\/a> available for employment-based needs and family-related purposes. The majority of immigrant visas granted in a given year are issued to family members of current U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. In most cases, a <a href=../../../../%22/immigration/family-based-relative/index.html>family-based immigration<\/a> visa requires the request to be filed and sponsored by a legal citizen or green card holder who is already living in the United States. The specific visa needed will depend on the <a href=../../../../%22/immigration/immediate-relative-visas/index.html>relationship of the immigrant<\/a> to the sponsor and other factors. The experienced attorneys at the Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC will work closely with you in determining the right type of visa for your situation, as well as in preparing and filing the application package. We are also equipped to help with <a href=../../../../%22/immigration/visa-denial-help-appeals/index.html>appealing visa denials<\/a>, as needed.<\/p><h3>Trusted Counsel for Deportation Defense in North Carolina<\/h3><p>In addition to family-related immigration concerns, our firm can also help if you are facing the possibility of being deported or removed from the United States. Deportation proceedings can be initiated against any non-citizen for violating immigration laws or being <a href=../../../../%22/immigration/criminal-convictions-impact-on-immigration/index.html>convicted of committing certain crimes<\/a>. Our attorneys will help you determine the best option for your situation, which may include requesting <a href=../../../../%22/immigration/asylum-refugee-legal-help/index.html>asylum<\/a> or seeking an Adjustment of Status to become a lawful permanent resident. If you are the <a href=../../../../%22/immigration/vawa-u-visa-crime-victims/index.html>victim of domestic violence or another crime<\/a>, you may be able to avoid deportation as well. We will do everything we can to help you stay in the United States legally and to protect your rights and best interests. <\/p><h3>Schedule a Free Consultation<\/h3><p>For more information about our law firm and our approach to immigration matters, <a href=../../../../%22/contact/index.html>contact us<\/a> today.
