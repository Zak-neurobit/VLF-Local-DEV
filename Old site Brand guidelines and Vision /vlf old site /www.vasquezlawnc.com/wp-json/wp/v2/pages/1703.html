This number does not include the thousands of other injuries suffered by public-sector\u2014or government\u2014workers annually. In an average year, well over 40,000 cases required the workers in question to miss work, be transferred to a different job, or be placed on restricted duty. <\/p>\n<p>At <a href=../../../../%22/attorneys/index.html>Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC<\/a>, we know the effects that a workplace injury can have on your life. In most such cases, you are likely to be eligible for <a href=../../../../%22/workers-compensation-job-injury/index.html>workers&#8217; compensation<\/a> benefits under the North Carolina Workers&#8217; Compensation Act. However, workers&#8217; comp benefits are not always sufficient to restore your life to where it once was. If a party other than your employer is responsible for the injuries that you have suffered\u2014even in part\u2014it may be in your best interest to pursue a third-party personal injury claim in addition to your claim with the state&#8217;s work comp system. A personal injury lawsuit might also be necessary if you are not eligible for workers&#8217; compensation benefits. <\/p>\n<h3>Skilled Counsel for North Carolina Workplace Injury Cases<\/h3>\n<p>If you have suffered an injury while on the job, North Carolina law specifies that you cannot file a lawsuit against the employer or your coworkers, with very rare exceptions. However, other negligent individuals or entities could potentially be liable for the injuries you have suffered, depending on the situation. For example, if you are employed as an electrician by a company that was subcontracted to work on a new building <a href=../../../../%22/workers-compensation-job-injury/construction-site-injuries/index.html>construction project<\/a>, the general contractor in charge of the project is responsible for keeping the site reasonably safe. If you are injured while doing your job on the site due to an unsafe working condition, you could file a workers&#8217; compensation claim as well as a third-party claim against the general contractor. A third-party claim could also be appropriate if your employment requires you to drive, and you are involved in a <a href=../../../../%22/personal-injury/car-auto-accidents/index.html>car crash<\/a> caused by another driver. <\/p>\n<h3>Holding the At-Fault Parties Accountable for Work-Related Accidents<\/h3>\n<p>The knowledgeable personal injury lawyers at Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC have over 35 years of combined experience.
