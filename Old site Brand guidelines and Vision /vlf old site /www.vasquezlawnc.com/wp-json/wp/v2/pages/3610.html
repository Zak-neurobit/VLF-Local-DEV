The federal laws that apply to family-based immigration can be complex and confusing, and it can be challenging to understand and meet the law's requirements. This is why it is so important to work closely with a qualified family-based immigration attorney as you seek to offer a better life and new opportunities to your loved ones. We have the experience, knowledge, and resources to help you obtain the necessary visas for your family members in a variety of circumstances or situations.<\/p><p>The skilled attorneys at our firm have over 35 years of combined experience in handling family-related immigration matters. We know how to anticipate and address potential issues in advance so that they do not become serious obstacles. Our team is dedicated to helping you secure a favorable result for your family member, no matter the challenges that may arise.<\/p><h3>Immigration Counsel for Families in North Carolina<\/h3><p>The area of family-based immigration encompasses a wide range of cases in which United States citizens and lawful permanent residents (\"<a href=\"\/immigration\/green-cards\">green card<\/a>\" holders) seek to bring their family members and future spouses to the U.S. legally. According to U.S. immigration law, lawful permanent residents and legal citizens can serve as sponsors to help their relatives obtain <a href=\"\/immigration\/family-visa-types\">permanent or temporary visas<\/a>. <\/p><p>Generally, the application process for family-based immigration is relatively straightforward. The process begins when a citizen or permanent resident files a completed Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) with the primary immigration agency of the U.S. government: United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, also known as USCIS. Once the petition is accepted by USCIS, the petitioner will be notified of a date after which the family members in question are able to apply for visas or green cards. <\/p><h3>Johnson County Lawyers Who Understand the Preference System for Family-Based Immigration<\/h3><p>The United States government allows for the approval of a limited number of family visas and permanent resident status applications in a given year. Therefore, a preference system has been created for processing family immigration requests. Legal spouses, minor children, and parents of current U.S. citizens over the age of 21 are <a href=\"\/immigration\/immediate-relative-visas\">immediate relatives<\/a>, which means they are not included in the family preference system. <\/p><p>Applications for other relatives, however, are considered in order based on the status of the petitioner and the relationship:<\/p><ul><li>First preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their unmarried children over the age of 21.<\/li><li>Second preference is given to petitions filed by permanent residents for their spouses and children. Minor children receive preference over adult children. <\/li><li>Third preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their married children and the immediate relatives of their married children. <\/li><li>Fourth preference is given to petitions filed by U.S. citizens for their siblings and the immediate relatives of their siblings. <\/li><\/ul><p>A family-based immigration petition will not be considered for grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, or in-laws.<\/p><h3>Smithfield Lawyers for Fianc\u00e9 Visas<\/h3><p>If you are a U.S. citizen or green card holder and you are engaged to a foreign national, it may be possible to obtain a K-visa to bring your fianc\u00e9 to the U.S. so that you can get married. A K-visa might also be helpful if you already married a foreign national abroad but your spouse has not received his or her green card yet. K-visas are commonly called \"<a href=\"\/immigration\/fiance-k-visas\">fianc\u00e9 visas<\/a>,\" and they are not permanent. Your future spouse's K-visa can be revoked if you never finalize the marriage or if your marriage is dissolved through <a href=\"\/family-law\/divorce\">divorce<\/a> or annulment. <\/p><h3>Work with a Knowledgeable North Carolina Immigration Lawyer<\/h3><p>Family-based immigration concerns can be complicated, and you may have several options for bringing your relatives or your fianc\u00e9 to the United States legally. At Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we will meet with you to discuss your situation and to determine the best way to meet your needs.
