										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The holiday season is a time of joy and celebration, but it can also be a time when people make poor decisions. Drunk driving is one such decision that can have serious consequences. If you are arrested and charged with <a href="../../../criminal-defense/dwi-drunk-driving.html">driving while impaired (DWI)</a> during the holidays, it is important to know what steps to take to protect your rights. An experienced <a href="../../../index.html">attorney</a> can provide legal representation when addressing DWI charges, helping you determine how to defend against a conviction and minimize the ways your life will be affected.</p>
<p>When you are pulled over on suspicion of drunk driving, you should:</p>
<h2>1. Stay Calm and Cooperate</h2>
<p>During a DWI traffic stop, it is crucial to remain calm and cooperate with police officers. Avoid any confrontations or arguments, as these actions will only escalate the situation further. You can provide your identification documents when requested and answer basic questions about your identity. This can help you avoid any misunderstandings.</p>
<h2>2. Understand Your Rights</h2>
<p>You have the right to remain silent, and you are not required to give a police officer any information that could potentially be incriminating. You can exercise this right by informing an officer that you decline to answer any questions about whether you have been drinking or engaging in any other potentially illegal activities.</p>
<p>While an officer may ask you to take a roadside breathalyzer test or step out of your vehicle and perform field sobriety tests, you can decline to do so. These tests are used to determine whether an officer has probable cause to perform an arrest for DWI, and agreeing to take these tests will provide evidence that could potentially be used against you.</p>
<h2>3. Understand the Consequences</h2>
<p>Being arrested for DWI during the holidays can have severe consequences that extend beyond legal penalties. In North Carolina, a first-time DWI offense is typically charged as a misdemeanor, and depending on the circumstances of the case, a conviction may result in <a href="https://www.ncdps.gov/our-organization/law-enforcement/state-highway-patrol/laws/driving-alcohol">penalties</a> such as fines, a <a href="https://www.ncdot.gov/dmv/license-id/license-suspension/Pages/driving-while-impaired.aspx">driver’s license revocation</a> for at least one year, jail time of at least 24 hours and up to 60 or 120 days. Even if you are not convicted of DWI, you will face a one-year driver’s license suspension if you refuse to take a chemical blood alcohol test after being arrested and taken to a police station.</p>
<p>In addition to these immediate consequences, a DWI conviction can also have long-term effects on your personal and professional life. It may impact your employment opportunities, increase your auto insurance premiums, or result in the loss of certain professional licenses.</p>
<h2>4. Contact an Experienced DWI Attorney</h2>
<p>As soon as possible after your arrest, you will want to reach out to a skilled DWI attorney. Your lawyer will guide you through every step of the legal process and provide advice on how to protect your rights and defend against DWI charges.</p>
<p>An experienced attorney will review all aspects of your arrest, including police procedures, breathalyzer tests, field sobriety tests, and other evidence gathered by law enforcement officers. They will work diligently towards building a strong defense strategy on your behalf.</p>
<h2>5. Gather Evidence</h2>
<p>Your attorney will work with you to gather evidence that supports your defense against the DWI charges. This may include obtaining witness statements, reviewing surveillance footage if available, challenging breathalyzer test results or field sobriety tests conducted by law enforcement officers, and providing any other details to counter the claims that you were driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<h2>6. Explore Possible Defenses</h2>
<p>An experienced DWI attorney will explore all possible defenses based on the specific circumstances of your case. They may challenge the legality of the traffic stop itself or question whether there was probable cause to perform an arrest. Your attorney may also examine whether proper procedures were followed during any chemical testing performed at the time of arrest. They may also negotiate with prosecutors to determine whether charges can be dismissed or reduced, and they will advise you on whether it may be beneficial to accept a plea bargain or defend yourself in a criminal trial.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Marijuana has been used for centuries by people around the world. Even though it has been found to be less harmful than legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco, and it also has a variety of medical benefits, it has been classified as an illegal <a style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600;" href="https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/ByArticle/Chapter_90/Article_5.html">controlled substance</a>. Because of this, many people have been charged with<a style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600;" href="../../../criminal-defense/drug-crime-cases.html"> drug crimes</a> related to the<a style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600;" href="../../../criminal-defense/drug-crime-cases/marijuana-cannabis-charges.html"> possession or distribution of marijuana</a>. However, attitudes surrounding marijuana use have been changing, and in many parts of the United States, it has been legalized for medical and recreational purposes. In the future, North Carolina could follow the example of other states and approve the drug for legal use in the state.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">New Marijuana Laws Introduced by North Carolina Lawmakers</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Several <a style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600;" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajherrington/2023/04/19/north-carolina-lawmakers-file-recreational-marijuana-legalization-bills/">bills have recently been introduced in the North Carolina state legislature</a> that could legalize marijuana possession and use by adults. House Bill 626 would allow people over the age of 21 to possess up to two ounces of marijuana, 15 grams of concentrated cannabis, products containing up to 2,000 milligrams of THC, or six cannabis plants. It would also allow for the sale and on-site consumption of marijuana at licensed businesses, and it would provide automatic expungement of criminal records for those who were convicted of marijuana offenses that would no longer be crimes following the passage of the law. This bill is currently being considered by North Carolina House of Representatives committees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 346 would make similar changes to North Carolina law. It contains the same provisions for the amount of marijuana adults would be able to possess, as well as automatic expungement of previous marijuana offenses and the prohibition of<a style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: 600;" href="../../../criminal-defense/dwi-drunk-driving.html"> driving while under the influence</a> of marijuana. However, it would also allow for the use of medical marijuana by people who receive registry identification cards after being certified by a doctor as having a condition that could benefit from the use of cannabis. This bill is currently being considered by the North Carolina Senate committees.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A separate bill is also pending that would legalize medical marijuana in North Carolina. Senate Bill 3 would allow patients with certain debilitating medical conditions to receive prescriptions for marijuana, and they would be protected from prosecution for possessing an adequate supply of medical marijuana. Qualifying conditions would include cancer, epilepsy, HIV/AIDS, Crohn&#8217;s disease, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, and terminal illnesses with a life expectancy of less than six months. This bill has been passed by the North Carolina Senate, and it is currently being considered by House of Representatives committees.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Current Marijuana Laws in North Carolina</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While the laws may change in the future, marijuana is still considered to be an illegal drug in North Carolina. Possession of less than one-half of an ounce is a Class 3 misdemeanor, and a conviction can result in a $200 fine. Possession of between 0.5 and 1.5 ounces is a Class 1 misdemeanor, which can lead to a sentence of up to 45 days in jail and a fine that may be set at the discretion of the court. Possession of more than one and one-half ounces is a Class I felony, and a person will usually be sentenced to between four and six months in jail, although longer or shorter sentences may be appropriate based on mitigating or aggravating circumstances and a person&#8217;s previous criminal record.</p>

Some DWI arrests are the result of a poor decision while other times, faulty breath testing devices or other issues lead to an unjustified DWI arrest.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you were charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI), you may also be very nervous about the consequences you face for your actions. While this is natural, it is also important to know that the legal consequences for something like a DWI are rarely set in stone. The advocacy of a great attorney can help you fight the charges and possibly even get them dropped.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: 800;">What Can an Attorney Do in My Defense?</h3>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on the facts of the case, an attorney has several options available for fighting the charges. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li>Questioning the validity of a breathalyzer result</li>
<li>Questioning the validity of the roadside test (if the officer asked you to walk in a straight line, count backward from 100, etc.)</li>
<li>Questioning the officer’s justification for pulling you over in the first place</li>
<li>Questioning the chain of custody of any evidence</li>
<li>Arguing that you are a first-time offender with no criminal history</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Using one or more of these strategies could result in the following actions:</p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li>Convincing the prosecutor not to file charges, or to drop charges if already filed</li>
<li>Reducing the charges you face</li>
<li>Negotiating a plea deal that allows you to stay out of jail or not go to trial</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to note that no outcome can be definitively guaranteed, but your prospects of avoiding harsh punishment are much higher with the help of an experienced attorney who knows local judges and prosecutors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For example, many prosecutors are willing to enter into plea deals for DWI cases, especially for first-time offenders. In exchange for a guilty plea and/or the promise to attend substance abuse counseling, you may receive a greatly reduced sentence or charge dropped from a DWI to a reckless driving. This may allow you to keep your driver’s license, pay lower fees, or avoid jail time.</p>
