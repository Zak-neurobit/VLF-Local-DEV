										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of a car accident, it’s easy to make decisions that could negatively impact your legal rights. You are very likely in a state of shock, and you might not know how best to help yourself. Many people don’t realize that the actions they take immediately after an accident can affect their ability to recover compensation for their injuries later on!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawyers of Vasquez Law Firm understand the playbook for acquiring personal injury compensation. Understanding the common legal mistakes to avoid after a car accident can help ensure that you protect your rights and increase your chances of a successful personal injury claim. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this blog, we’ll discuss some of the most common legal mistakes people make after a car accident and how to avoid them.</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Failing to Seek Medical Attention</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common legal mistakes to avoid after a car accident is not seeking medical attention right away. Even if you feel fine or believe your injuries are minor, it’s essential to get a medical evaluation as soon as possible. Many injuries, such as whiplash or internal damage, may not show symptoms immediately but can worsen over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failing to seek medical care can hurt your personal injury claim because the insurance company may argue that your injuries weren’t serious or were caused by something other than the accident. To protect yourself, always seek medical attention following a car accident and keep detailed records of your diagnosis and treatment.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Not Calling the Police</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another critical legal mistake to avoid after a car accident is failing to call the police to the scene. In North Carolina, you’re required to report an accident to law enforcement if it results in injury, death, or significant property damage. Even in minor accidents, having an official police report can be valuable evidence when filing an insurance claim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The police report will document important details, such as the time and location of the accident, statements from the drivers and witnesses, and whether any traffic violations occurred. Without this report, it may be your word against the other driver’s, making it more challenging to prove liability.</span></p>
<h3><b>3. Admitting Fault</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of an accident, it’s natural to feel shaken and confused, but one of the biggest legal mistakes to avoid after a car accident is admitting fault or apologizing for the crash. Even if you think you may be partially responsible, avoid making any statements that could be interpreted as admitting guilt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance companies will often use these statements to reduce or deny your claim. Instead of discussing fault, stick to the facts when speaking to law enforcement or insurance representatives. Let your attorney handle any discussions regarding liability.</span></p>
<h3><b>4. Not Collecting Evidence at the Scene</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failing to gather evidence at the scene of the accident is another common legal mistake to avoid after a car accident. While the police will gather some information, it’s crucial that you collect your own evidence to support your case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the following steps to gather essential evidence at the scene:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Photographs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Take pictures of the vehicles, road conditions, traffic signs, and any visible injuries.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Contact Information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Get the names, phone numbers, and insurance details of the other driver(s) involved in the accident.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
<p></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Witnesses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Speak to any witnesses who saw the accident happen and ask for their contact information.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This evidence can be invaluable when filing an insurance claim or pursuing a personal injury lawsuit.</span></p>
<h3><b>5. Waiting Too Long to File a Claim</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a car accident, it’s essential to act quickly in filing your insurance claim or lawsuit. One of the most common legal mistakes to avoid after a car accident is waiting too long to initiate the claims process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In North Carolina, the </span><a href="https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_1/gs_1-52.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statute of limitations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for personal injury claims is generally three years from the date of the accident. If you wait longer than this, you may lose your right to pursue compensation. However, it’s best to start the process much earlier, as waiting too long can weaken your case. Witnesses’ memories may fade, and evidence may be harder to gather as time passes.</span></p>
<h3><b>6. Speaking to the Insurance Company Without Legal Representation</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people make the mistake of speaking to the at-fault driver’s insurance company without first </span><a href="../../../north-carolina-attorney/6-reasons-why-you-should-hire-a-personal-injury-lawyer.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consulting a lawyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is one of the most significant legal mistakes to avoid after a car accident, as insurance companies often try to minimize payouts by using your statements against you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance adjusters may ask leading questions or request a recorded statement, which could be used to diminish your claim. Before speaking with the insurance company, it’s important to consult with a personal injury attorney who can guide you through the process and handle communication on your behalf.</span></p>
<h3><b>7. Accepting a Quick Settlement Offer</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance companies may offer you a settlement shortly after the accident, especially if liability is clear. While it may be tempting to accept the money and move on, this is often a legal mistake to avoid after a car accident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first settlement offer is typically much lower than what you deserve. Accepting it can prevent you from seeking additional compensation later, even if your medical bills and other expenses continue to rise. Always consult with a lawyer before accepting any settlement offers to ensure that you’re getting a fair deal.</span></p>
<h3><b>8. Failing to Keep Detailed Records</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crucial step in protecting your rights after a car accident is keeping detailed records of everything related to the accident and your injuries. Failing to do so is a common legal mistake to avoid after a car accident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep track of the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical bills and records</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repair estimates for your vehicle</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lost wages due to time off work</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Correspondence with insurance companies</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These records will be critical in building a strong case and ensuring that you receive the compensation you deserve.</span></p>
<h3><b>9. Not Hiring an Experienced Personal Injury Lawyer</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most significant legal mistake to avoid after a car accident is not hiring an experienced personal injury lawyer to represent you. Car accident cases can be complicated, and having a knowledgeable attorney by your side can make a substantial difference in the outcome of your case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An experienced lawyer will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigate the accident thoroughly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negotiate with insurance companies on your behalf</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Help you gather evidence and expert testimony</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advise you on when to settle or pursue litigation</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without legal representation, you risk accepting less compensation than you’re entitled to or facing unnecessary delays in your case.</span></p>
<h3><b>10. Underestimating the Long-Term Impact of Injuries</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, one of the common legal mistakes to avoid after a car accident is underestimating the long-term impact of your injuries. Some injuries may require ongoing medical treatment or lead to permanent disability, affecting your ability to work and enjoy life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before accepting any settlement, make sure you fully understand the extent of your injuries and how they will impact you in the future. Your attorney can help you calculate the long-term costs associated with your injuries, including medical expenses, lost wages, and pain and suffering.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are injured in an auto accident, it can be difficult to keep a clear head and look to the future. Nonetheless, when you are trying to claim compensation for your injuries and damages to your property, there are certain efforts you want to make immediately following the crash and beyond. If you are able to collect as much documentation as possible, you have a better chance of being granted the proper damages to which you are entitled down the line. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawyers of Vasquez Law Firm have compiled a list of types of evidence that can be used to support your claim for compensation in the event that you get into an auto accident. If you are able, collect and keep track of this evidence as thoroughly as possible in order to maximize your claim. </span></p>
<p><b>Photos And Videos </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following an accident, you want to document the scene, assuming your injuries do not prevent you from doing so. If you are conscious and can do so without aggravating your injuries, take as many photos and videos as possible of the accident, including damage to your vehicle, skid marks on the road, the position of the cars, street signs, weather conditions, debris, and license plates. Also take photos of any injuries on yourself and your passengers that are immediately apparent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-dash-cam/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dash cam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a useful tool for any time you are on the road, and they are especially useful in the event of an accident. If you have a dash cam that documented the accident, make sure to back up the file and distribute it to your lawyer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on where the accident occurred, such as in front businesses or homes with cameras, your lawyer might also be able to request surveillance video that happened to capture the accident, which can lend credence to your testimony regarding who was at fault. </span></p>
<p><b>Police Reports</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After you get into an accident, your first move should be contacting police and medical assistance. When authorities arrive on the scene, they will take your statement and the statement of the other driver, and their report will include information such as the location of the crash, the time, and any tickets issued to either party. Access to the police report is especially important when working with insurance companies because police are regarded as authoritative, unbiased sources on accident information.</span></p>
<p><b>Medical Records</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you get into an accident, always call for an ambulance and have your injuries evaluated even if you feel that you have not been significantly injured. In some cases, the shock from the accident can delay the pain from your injuries, and you might even exacerbate the damage to yourself. In other cases, you might be suffering internal injuries that can cause problems down the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, it’s important to have your injuries assessed immediately because medical records are an important part of your claim. If you wait to receive medical attention, your insurance company might argue that you did not sustain your injuries as a direct result of the accident. Keep the records of your medical expenses as well as thorough documentation of the care that you received including surgery, medication, scans, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Important to note is that if you receive mental health treatment related to trauma, depression, or anxiety because of your accident, you can likewise be entitled to damages for these issues.</span></p>
<p><b>Witness Statements</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statements from people who witnessed your accident can help corroborate your version of events. If you feel able to do so, speak to anyone who stopped to assist you in your accident, get their names and contact information, and have your lawyer reach out to them for their recollection of the accident. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, police records might note any people who were able to give their eyewitness reports, in which case your lawyer can try to reach out to them through the information available in the report. </span></p>
<p><b>Expert Testimony</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, experts ranging from accident reconstruction specialists to medical professionals can offer their analyses on the specifics of your accident and the extent of your injuries. Psychology professionals can also testify regarding the trauma and emotional damage the accident has inflicted.</span></p>
<p><b>Property Damage Records</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides yourself, there are many material objects that can be damaged in an auto accident and for which you should be compensated. An obvious one is your vehicle. If your car is too damaged to be fixed, you should be compensated for the new one, so be sure to keep your receipts. Otherwise, keep similar documentation on the cost to fix your car as well as the cost of obtaining a rental car for travel in the meantime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other property in your vehicle, such as clothing that might be ripped or splashed with blood, eyeglasses that are broken, phones that are damaged, and more can be part of your claim. If you have to replace any broken possessions as part of your accident, speak with your attorney about the prices of your valuables.</span></p>
<p><b>Pay Stubs And Employment Records</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you lost wages at your job due to your accident or you have a diminished earning capacity because of your injury, you should collect your pay stubs, records of your work absences, as well as records of any other losses such as if you missed out on a pay increase or other advancement due to your lack of attendance. Your lawyer will work with you to assess the economic damage that you have suffered and request the proper compensation.</span></p>
