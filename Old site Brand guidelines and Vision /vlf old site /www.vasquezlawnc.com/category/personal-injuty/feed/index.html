You may think you can handle your<a href="../../../personal-injury.html"> personal injury</a> case successfully on your own and that there are no benefits to working with an experienced lawyer. However, you should know that, while you do not have to hire an attorney, people with effective legal representation typically receive significantly higher settlements. The skilled<a href="../../../index.html"> lawyers</a> at Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC will work diligently to help you maximize your payout. Personal injury attorneys help recover maximum compensation by using the following strategies.</p>
<h2>Investigating Accidents</h2>
<p>To get compensation, you will need evidence proving another party’s negligence to qualify for a personal injury claim. It often takes an in-depth investigation to find the right kinds of supporting evidence.</p>
<p>Most people have never conducted a thorough investigation and do not know how to identify important evidence. Your legal team from Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC has investigated numerous accidents, so we will undertake this task for you.</p>
<h2>Assigning Fault Accurately</h2>
<p>More than one party shares the blame for causing many accidents. It is very important that you are not found to be at fault in NC accidents because of the state’s negligence laws. Liable insurers may try to cast blame onto you to avoid paying your claim. We will ensure that any fault assigned to you is fair.</p>
<h2>Dealing With North Carolina Negligence Laws</h2>
<p>Every U.S. state has laws that govern the eligibility to obtain compensation after an injury accident. Most states use a form of modified comparative negligence. Although state legislators have made several attempts to<a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/H811"> change these statutes</a>, North Carolina remains one of only four states using pure contributory negligence.</p>
<p>Pure contributory negligence means that if you are even one percent responsible for causing your accident, you cannot obtain compensation from other at-fault parties. This law may make you think you do not have a case. There may be exceptions, and your attorney will work toward a favorable outcome.</p>
<h2>Calculating Damages</h2>
<p>If you qualify to obtain compensation, you may be eligible for several kinds of damages. These reimburse or compensate you for accident-related losses. You probably do not know how to value your qualifying damages, which can result in accepting a settlement that does not cover everything. Your lawyer can accurately assess your case’s value.</p>
<h2>Combatting Insurance Company Tactics</h2>
<p>Insurance companies would rather protect their bottom lines than pay valid claims. They routinely use unfair tactics to pay you less than you deserve. Arguing with an insurer can be intimidating to most people. Fortunately, Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC will stand up to them; we will not let them take advantage of you.</p>
<h2>Giving You Peace of Mind</h2>
<p>Not knowing how to deal with potential challenges in a personal injury claim is upsetting. You may worry that you will miss a vital detail, resulting in a low settlement offer or claim denial. When you work with Vasquez Law Firm, PLLC, we will do all the heavy lifting. You can rest easy knowing we are fighting to safeguard your best interests.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Navigating the rules of the road can be challenging, especially when encountering emergency vehicles like police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances. Understanding your obligations as a private motorist when you get into an <a href="../../../personal-injury/emergency-vehicle-accidents.html">accident</a> with an emergency vehicle and whether these vehicles are exempt from traffic laws can help you handle these situations more effectively. If you live in North Carolina and were in an accident with an emergency vehicle, contact an <a href="../../../index.html">attorney</a> to ensure you understand your rights completely.</p>
<h2>What to Do If You Get into An Accident with an Emergency Vehicle</h2>
<p>Getting into an accident with an emergency vehicle can be a stressful and confusing experience. Some tips to recovering from such an accident include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay calm and safe – First and foremost, ensure everyone’s safety. If possible, move to a safe location and check for injuries. Call 911 immediately to report the accident and request medical assistance.</li>
<li>Exchange information – Just like any other accident, exchange information with the driver of the emergency vehicle. This includes names, contact details, insurance information, and vehicle registration. Cooperate, but avoid discussing or admitting fault at the scene.</li>
<li>Document the scene – Take pictures and videos of the accident scene, vehicle damages, and any relevant traffic signals or road conditions. Gather contact information from witnesses who can provide an unbiased account of the accident.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Are Emergency Vehicles Exempt from Traffic Laws?</h2>
<p>Emergency vehicles are given certain privileges under North Carolina law to perform their duties effectively. However, these exemptions come with specific conditions. Examples of traffic law exemptions for emergency vehicles include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exceed speed limits when responding to emergencies.</li>
<li>Proceed through red lights or stop signs after ensuring it is safe to do so.</li>
<li>Travel against the flow of traffic or on the shoulder of a road when necessary.</li>
<li>Park in restricted areas to carry out emergency functions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Emergency Vehicles Still Must Exercise a Duty of Care</h2>
<p>While they do have some leeway, emergency vehicle operators are required to drive with regard to the safety of all road users. Negligent driving, even if responding to an emergency, can result in liability for damages and injuries.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities of a Private Motorist</h2>
<p>As a private motorist, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yield to the right-of-way of emergency vehicles displaying flashing lights and sounding sirens.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ncdps.gov/our-organization/law-enforcement/state-highway-patrol/laws/move-over-law#:~:text=The%20law%20requires%20motorists%20slow,and%20can%20do%20so%20safely.">Move</a> to the side of the road and come to a complete stop, allowing the emergency vehicle to pass.</li>
<li>Avoid obstructing emergency vehicles and provide them with a clear path.</li>
</ul>

However, some drivers may violate these regulations due to tight deadlines or pressure from employers. Continuing to drive past the point of exhaustion can make a driver more likely to fall asleep behind the wheel or make dangerous mistakes.

One of the primary causes of <a href="../../../personal-injury/truck-accidents.html">truck accidents</a> is driver fatigue. Fatigued truck drivers pose a significant risk on the road, not only to themselves but also to other motorists.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The Dangers of Fatigue for Truck Drivers</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Driving a commercial truck requires immense concentration, coordination, and alertness. There are many <a href="https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/ss/slideshow-fatigue-causes-and-remedies">factors</a> can contribute to truck driver fatigue:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Inadequate sleep:</strong> Truck drivers often have demanding schedules that leave little time for adequate rest. Sleep deprivation affects a driver’s ability to stay focused and react quickly while on the road.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Long hours:</strong> Federal regulations limit the number of hours a commercial truck driver can be behind the wheel on a daily and weekly basis. However, some drivers may violate these regulations due to tight deadlines or pressure from employers. Continuing to drive past the point of exhaustion can make a driver more likely to fall asleep behind the wheel or make dangerous mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Night shifts:</strong> Working during nighttime disrupts natural sleep patterns, as human bodies are naturally predisposed to sleeping at night. Night-time driving increases the risk of drowsiness and reduces alertness. Drivers will also be more likely to become dangerously fatigued if they work irregular hours or have inconsistent shifts.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Poor sleeping conditions:</strong> Some long-haul truck drivers live out of their trucks while on duty. The lack of comfortable sleeping arrangements can lead to poor-quality sleep or difficulty falling asleep.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Medical conditions:</strong> Issues with a driver’s physical help can prevent them from getting proper sleep or make them more likely to become fatigued. Sleep apnea is a common concern that can lead to drowsiness, and other conditions that can lead to fatigue include diabetes, hypothyroidism, anemia, heart disease, and fibromyalgia.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Dehydration:</strong> If truck drivers do not drink enough water during driving shifts, they will be more likely to become fatigued.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Overuse of caffeine:</strong> Truck drivers may use caffeinated beverages to help stay awake or combat fatigue. While drinking coffee, soda, or energy drinks can help increase alertness, too much caffeine can actually have the opposite effect, especially when a driver experiences issues such as jitteriness or increased heart rate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">The Dangers Posed by Fatigued Truck Drivers</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Fatigue impairs a person&#8217;s cognitive abilities and slows down their reaction times when faced with unexpected situations on the road. For truck drivers who operate large vehicles weighing several tons, any delay in response could have catastrophic consequences. Some dangerous effects of fatigue include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Distracted driving:</strong> Fatigued truck drivers are more likely to become distracted. For example, they may reach for food or drinks, use their smartphones, or engage in other activities that divert their attention from the road.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Reduced awareness:</strong> Extreme fatigue can impair a driver&#8217;s ability to perceive hazards and react appropriately. This includes failure to notice road signs, traffic signals, or other vehicles on the road.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Microsleeps:</strong> Severe fatigue can lead to episodes of drowsiness in which a driver falls asleep briefly. These momentary lapses in consciousness can last just a few seconds, but this is enough time for a truck driver to lose control of their vehicle and cause an accident.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Contact Our Smithfield Truck Accident Lawyers</h2>

The medical expenses, loss of income, and emotional trauma caused by an accident can quickly add up, leaving the victim with substantial financial burdens. If the accident was caused by someone else&#8217;s negligence or intentional actions, the victim might be eligible to pursue a personal injury claim and seek compensation for their damages.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In North Carolina, a victim can recover several types of damages in a motorcycle accident injury claim.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These damages fall into two broad categories: compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Compensatory Damages</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Compensatory damages are intended to repay the victim for the losses caused by the motorcycle accident. These damages can be categorized into various subsections, such as:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Economic Damages &#8211; The economic impact of the accident is expressed in quantifiable financial losses, such as medical costs, lost wages, diminished career opportunities, and motorcycle repairs or replacement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Non-Economic Damages &#8211; Non-monetary damage, such as psychological pain, emotional anguish, and the inability to enjoy life at its fullest capacity, can all be the results of a motorcycle accident. Such non-economic losses are known as non-economic damages.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Punitive Damages</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Punitive damages are designed to punish the defendant for their actions and deter similar behavior in the future. These damages are only awarded in cases where the defendant&#8217;s conduct was particularly egregious, intentional, or malicious. North Carolina has a cap on punitive damages. This means that the plaintiff can receive up to three times the amount of compensatory damages awarded or $250,000, whichever is more significant.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">How Can You Claim These Damages?</h3>
<p dir="ltr">If you have been injured in a motorcycle crash caused by another person, it is essential that you contact an experienced lawyer urgently. With their knowledge and ability to assess your situation, they will identify the appropriate damages needed to cover the costs of your accident. They are committed to safeguarding your rights and pursuing justice for you.</p>

<h3>Dog Bite Injuries</h3>
<p>Dogs may be man’s best friend, but they are also animals that can act in unpredictable ways. In a matter of just a few seconds, a dog can cause serious injuries, especially to small children. Common dog bite injuries include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Lacerations to hands, arms, face, and neck</li>
<li>Disfiguring cosmetic damage, including scarring</li>
<li>Nerve damage</li>
<li>Torn ligaments</li>
<li>Serious bleeding</li>
<li>Infections</li>
<li>Broken or fractured bones</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is a Dangerous Dog?</h3>
<p>Every state defines “dangerous dog” a little differently, but in North Carolina, a dangerous dog is one that has already, without provocation, seriously hurt or killed someone else. Furthermore, dogs used for dog fighting or those simply trained for dog fighting can be designated a dangerous dog, whether or not they have already attacked someone. A “potentially dangerous dog” is a dog that has injured someone badly enough to require hospitalization or cosmetic surgery, one that has seriously injured or killed another animal, or one that has approached someone who is not on the dog owner’s property in a way that appears the dog is about to attack. Sometimes even when someone is on the dog owner’s property, but is allowed to be there, <a href="../../../personal-injury/premises-liability.html">premises liability</a> laws can hold the dog owner responsible for a dog attack. Whether a dog has been designated a dangerous dog or a potentially dangerous dog can affect a dog owner’s liability.</p>
<p>Although there can be exceptions, usually once a dog has bitten or attacked someone unprovoked, the owner is liable in the future for any bites or attacks by their dog. This places a significant responsibility on the owner to restrain the dog and to make sure it never has the opportunity or ability to attack someone. If it does, the dog owner can be sued. However, there are other circumstances under which a dog’s owner can be sued, even if the dog was not designated a dangerous dog, so it is important to speak with an attorney who can examine the specific facts in your case.</p>
