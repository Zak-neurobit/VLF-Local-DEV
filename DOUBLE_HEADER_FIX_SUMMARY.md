# Double Header Fix Summary

## Problem
Pages were showing double headers because:
1. The root `layout.tsx` was wrapping all pages with ConsistentHeader
2. Individual pages were also importing and using MasterLayout/SSRSafeMasterLayout which includes its own header

## Solution Implemented
1. Created a script `scripts/remove-duplicate-layouts.js` to automatically remove MasterLayout imports and wrappers from pages
2. Processed 38 files and successfully modified 37 of them
3. Pages now rely solely on the root layout for header/footer structure

## Files Modified
- 37 page files had their MasterLayout/SSRSafeMasterLayout imports and wrappers removed
- Pages now render their content directly without duplicate layout wrappers

## Template Files (Not Modified)
The following template files still contain MasterLayout imports - this is correct as they are reusable components:
- src/components/templates/ModernPracticeAreaTemplate.tsx
- src/components/About/AboutPageClient.tsx
- src/components/templates/CityPageTemplate.tsx
- src/components/templates/BlogPageTemplate.tsx
- src/components/templates/NeighborhoodPageTemplate.tsx
- src/components/templates/SpanishLocationPageTemplate.tsx
- src/components/templates/PracticeAreaTemplate.tsx
- src/components/templates/HomePageTemplate.tsx
- src/components/templates/ModernPracticeAreaTemplateV2.tsx
- src/components/templates/LocationServicePageTemplate.tsx
- src/components/templates/LocationPageTemplate.tsx
- src/components/Scholarships/ScholarshipsPageClient.tsx
- src/components/attorneys/AttorneyPageTemplate.tsx

## Next Steps
1. Test the application to ensure all pages render correctly with single headers
2. If any pages still show double headers, they may be using template components that include MasterLayout
3. Monitor for any styling or layout issues that may need adjustment

## Verification
To verify the fix worked:
- Run the dev server: `npm run dev`
- Visit different pages and check that only one header appears
- Check that navigation and layout functionality remains intact
