  "summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is announcing its intent to enter into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Teledyne FLIR to evaluate their Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology and address its ability to train models for needs specific to USCG operations. The Research and Development Center desires to identify the capabilities, benefits, risks, and limitations of Electro- Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) systems for integration with other shipboard systems. This will include testing of the technology and data collection in dynamic environmental conditions. In addition to increasing target classification efficacy, this work includes developing detection and classification information sharing standards with external command and control (C2) systems.",
