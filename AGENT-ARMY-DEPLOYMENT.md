   ```

2. **Test the Endpoints**:

3. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Check Vercel logs for agent execution

### Build Optimizations

The following folders are now excluded from Vercel builds:
- `Old site Brand guidelines and Vision/`
- `vlf old site/`
- `backup-untracked-files/`
- `content-import/`
- All build logs and deployment scripts

This significantly reduces deployment size and speeds up builds.
